"""
Randomly select N=100 (or 1000) TFA CDIPS light curves.
(Optionally select them to be only the LCs with strong LS FAPs already?)
Then inject a 0.5 RJup central-transit planet with periods in the range 1â€“15
d.  Try recovering via TLS (a) without detrending, (b) with detrending.
(For each light curve, do say 10 experiments).

For case (b), first-pass try using
the robust Huber spline (with w = 0.3 d) and also the sliding
biweight (w = 0.25 d). For a sliding biweight, if w/T14 > 2.2, most (> 98%)
of the flux integral is preserved. So anything between w=0.25 days to w=0.5
days should be good...
