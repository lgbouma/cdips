This one is how I learned that the “fuzz” around NGC2516 is real. I don’t think its actually a member, though. Long story. The fuzz is real because it has a narrow Prot vs Teff sequence, coeval with Pleiades. Also, the isochronal sequence is much more clustered than randomly chosen field stars. However TOI 1937 is one of a few outliers above the narrow Prot vs Teff sequence (Prot of ~7days, for Teff 5700 K). Prot should be like 4 days. Also, the star does not lithium, when it really should."
