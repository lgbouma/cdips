	abstract = {We report on the results of an 8-year survey carried out at the La Silla 
Observatory with the HARPS spectrograph to detect and characterize
planets in the super-Earth and Neptune mass regime. The size of our star
sample and the precision achieved with HARPS have allowed the detection
of a sufficiently large number of low-mass planets to study the
statistical properties of their orbital elements, the correlation of the
host-star metallicity with the planet masses, as well as the occurrence
rate of planetary systems around solar-type stars. A robust estimate of
the frequency of systems shows that more than 50\% of solar-type stars
harbor at least one planet of any mass and with period up to 100 days.
Different properties are observed for the population of planets less
massive than about 30M-Earth compared to the population of gaseous giant
planets. The mass distribution of Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets
(SEN) is strongly increasing between 30 and 15M-Earth. The SEN occurence
rate does not exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. Most of the SEN
planets belong to multi-planetary systems. The orbital eccentricities of
the SEN planets seems limited to 0.45. At the opposite, the occurence
rate of gaseous giant planets is growing with the logarithm of the
period, and is strongly increasing with the host-star metallicity. About
14\% of solar-type stars have a planetary companion more massive than
50M-Earth? on an orbit with a period shorter than 10 years. Orbital
eccentricities of giant planets are observed up to 0.9 and beyond. The
precision of HARPS-type spectrographs opens the possibility to detect
planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. Identification of a
significant number of super-Earths orbiting solar-type of the Sun
vicinity is achieved by Doppler spectroscopy. 37 newly discovered
planets are announced in the Appendix of this paper, among which 15
Super-Earths.},

	abstract = {We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius, orbital period, and stellar effective temperature for orbital periods less than 50 days around solar-type (GK) stars. These results are based on the 1235 planets (formally "planet candidates") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set of detected planets as small as 2 R ⊕. For each of the 156,000 target stars, we
assess the detectability of planets as a function of planet radius, R p, and orbital period, P, using a measure of the detection efficiency for each star. We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R sstarf/a. We consider first Kepler target stars within the "solar subset" having T eff = 4100-6100 K, log g = 4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp {\textless} 15 mag, i.e., bright,
main-sequence GK stars. We include only those stars having photometric noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 R
⊕. We count planets in small domains of R p and P and divide by the included target stars to calculate planet occurrence in each domain. The resulting occurrence of planets varies by more than three orders of magnitude in the radius-orbital period plane and increases substantially down to the smallest radius (2 R
⊕) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days,
{\textasciitilde}0.25 AU) in our study. For P {\textless} 50 days, the distribution of planet radii is given by a power law, df/dlog R = kRR
α with kR = 2.9+0.5 -
0.4, α = -1.92 ± 0.11, and R ≡ R p/R
⊕. This rapid increase in planet occurrence with
decreasing planet size agrees with the prediction of core-accretion formation but disagrees with population synthesis models that predict a desert at super-Earth and Neptune sizes for close-in orbits. Planets with orbital periods shorter than 2 days are extremely rare; for R p {\textgreater} 2 R ⊕ we measure an occurrence of
less than 0.001 planets per star. For all planets with orbital periods less than 50 days, we measure occurrence of 0.130 ± 0.008, 0.023 ± 0.003, and 0.013 ± 0.002 planets per star for planets
with radii 2-4, 4-8, and 8-32 R ⊕, in agreement with
Doppler surveys. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power-law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P 0. For smaller planets, P 0 has larger values, suggesting that the "parking distance" for migrating planets moves outward with
decreasing planet size. We also measured planet occurrence over a broader stellar T eff range of 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. Over this range, the occurrence of 2-4 R ⊕
planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing T eff, with these small planets being seven times more abundant around cool stars (3600-4100 K) than the hottest stars in our sample (6600-7100 K).

	shorttitle = {Estimating distances from parallaxes {IV}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10121},
	abstract = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction towards, individual stars. We analyse the characteristics of the catalogue and validate it using clusters. The catalogue can be queried using ADQL at http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html (which also hosts the Gaia catalogue) as the table geometric\_distance in the schema gaiadr2\_complements. The catalogue will go live on or before 30 April. Before that you can access it as a set of CSV files from http://www.mpia.de/{\textasciitilde}calj/gdr2\_distances.html .},

	abstract = {The fourth United States Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD Astrograph Catalog, UCAC4, was released in 2012 August (double-sided DVD and CDS data center Vizier catalog I/322). It is the final release in this series and contains over 113 million objects; over 105 million of them with proper motions (PMs). UCAC4 is an updated version of UCAC3 with about the same number of stars also covering all-sky. Bugs were fixed, Schmidt plate survey data were avoided, and precise five-band photometry was added for about half the stars. Astrograph observations have been supplemented for bright stars by FK6, Hipparcos, and Tycho-2 data to compile a UCAC4 star catalog complete from the brightest stars to about magnitude R = 16. Epoch 1998-2004 positions are obtained from observations with the 20 cm aperture USNO Astrograph's "red lens," equipped with a 4k by 4k CCD. Mean positions and PMs are derived by combining these observations with over 140 ground- and space-based catalogs, including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as unpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs. For most of the faint stars in the southern hemisphere, the first epoch plates from the Southern Proper Motion program form the basis for PMs, while the Northern Proper Motion first epoch plates serve the same purpose for the rest of the sky. These data are supplemented by 2MASS near-IR photometry for about 110 million stars and five-band (B, V, g, r, i) APASS data for over 51 million stars. Thus the published UCAC4, as were UCAC3 and UCAC2, is a compiled catalog with the UCAC observational program being a major component. The positional accuracy of stars in UCAC4 at mean epoch is about 15-100 mas per coordinate, depending on magnitude, while the formal errors in PMs range from about 1 to 10 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} depending on magnitude and observing history. Systematic errors in PMs are estimated to be about 1-4 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.},

With three premier sites spread out in longitude (Chile, Namibia, Australia), the HATSouth network permits round-the-clock observations of a 128 square arcdegree swath of the sky at any given time, weather permitting. As of this writing, HATSouth has discovered 36 transiting exoplanets. Many of the altogether ∼100 HAT and HATSouth exoplanets were the first of their kind.

	abstract = {The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) contains, beyond the astrometry, three-band photometry for 1.38 billion sources. One band is the G band, the other two were obtained by integrating the Gaia prism spectra (BP and RP). We have used these three broad photometric bands to infer stellar effective temperatures, T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, for all sources brighter than G = 17 mag with T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in the range 3000-10 000 K (some 161 million sources). Using in addition the parallaxes, we infer the line-of-sight extinction, A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}G{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and the reddening, E(BP - RP), for 88 million sources. Together with a bolometric correction we derive luminosity and radius for 77 million sources. These quantities as well as their estimated uncertainties are part of Gaia DR2. Here we describe the procedures by which these quantities were obtained, including the underlying assumptions, comparison with literature estimates, and the limitations of our results. Typical accuracies are of order 324 K (T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), 0.46 mag (A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}G{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), 0.23 mag (E(BP - RP)), 15\% (luminosity), and 10\% (radius). Being based on only a small number of observable quantities and limited training data, our results are necessarily subject to some extreme assumptions that can lead to strong systematics in some cases (not included in the aforementioned accuracy estimates). One aspect is the non-negativity contraint of our estimates, in particular extinction, which we discuss. Yet in several regions of parameter space our results show very good performance, for example for red clump stars and solar analogues. Large uncertainties render the extinctions less useful at the individual star level, but they show good performance for ensemble estimates. We identify regimes in which our parameters should and should not be used and we define a "clean" sample. Despite the limitations, this is the largest catalogue of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. More precise and detailed astrophysical parameters based on the full BP/RP spectrophotometry are planned as part of the third Gaia data release.},

	abstract = {Young exoplanets are snapshots of the planetary evolution process. Planets that orbit stars in young associations are particularly important because the age of the planetary system is well constrained. We present the discovery of a transiting planet larger than Neptune but smaller than Saturn in the 45 Myr Tucana-Horologium young moving group. The host star is a visual binary, and our follow-up observations demonstrate that the planet orbits the G6V primary component, DS Tuc A (HD 222259A, TIC 410214986). We first identified transits using photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; alerted as TOI 200.01). We validated the planet and improved the stellar parameters using a suite of new and archival data, including spectra from SOAR/Goodman, SALT/HRS and LCO/NRES; transit photometry from Spitzer; and deep adaptive optics imaging from Gemini/GPI. No additional stellar or planetary signals are seen in the data. We measured the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the photometry with a transit model and a Gaussian process to account for stellar variability. We determined that the planetary radius is \$5.70{\textbackslash}pm0.17\$ Earth radii and that the orbital period is 8.1 days. The inclination angles of the host star's spin axis, the planet's orbital axis, and the visual binary's orbital axis are aligned within 15 degrees to within the uncertainties of the relevant data. DS Tuc Ab is bright enough (V=8.5) for detailed characterization using radial velocities and transmission spectroscopy.},

Using the Gaia-measured distance and broad-band photometry we find that the host star is an M3 dwarf. Combined with the TESS transits from one sector, the corresponding stellar parameters yield planet radii ranging from 0.7 REarth to 1.3 REarth. All three planets have short orbital periods, ranging from 2.25 to 7.45 days with the outer pair just wide of a 2:1 period resonance. Diagnostic tests produced by the TESS Data Validation and the vetting package DAVE rule out common false positive sources. These analyses, along with dedicated follow-up and the multiplicity of the system, lend confidence that the observed signals are caused by planets transiting L 98-59 and are not associated with other sources in the field. The L 98-59 system is interesting for a number of reasons: the host star is bright (V = 11.7 mag, K = 7.1 mag) and the planets are prime targets for further follow-up observations including precision radial-velocity mass measurements and future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope; the near resonant configuration makes the system a laboratory to study planetary system dynamical evolution; and three planets of relatively similar size in the same system present an opportunity to study terrestrial planets where other variables (age, metallicity, etc.) can be held constant. L 98-59 will be observed in 6 more TESS sectors, which will provide a wealth of information on the three currently known planets and have the potential to reveal additional planets in the system.},

In addition to advantages of the Lomb–Scargle method such as treatment of non-uniform sampling and heteroscedastic errors, the multiband periodogram significantly improves period finding for randomly sampled multiband light curves (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DES, and LSST). The light curves in each band are modeled as arbitrary truncated Fourier series, with the period and phase shared across all bands. The key aspect is the use of Tikhonov regularization which drives most of the variability into the so-called base model common to all bands, while fits for individual bands describe residuals relative to the base model and typically require lower-order Fourier series. This decrease in the effective model complexity is the main reason for improved performance. After a pedagogical development of the formalism of least-squares spectral analysis, which motivates the essential features of the multiband model, we use simulated light curves and randomly subsampled SDSS Stripe 82 data to demonstrate the superiority of this method compared to other methods from the literature and find that this method will be able to efficiently determine the correct period in the majority of LSST’s bright RR Lyrae stars with as little as six months of LSST data, a vast improvement over the years of data reported to be required by previous studies. A Python implementation of this method, along with code to fully reproduce the results reported here, is available on GitHub.},

    photometry requires the removal or modeling of instrumental and stellar 
    noise. While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as 
    pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving 
    transit signals proves challenging. Due to vast archives of light curves 
    from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic 
    detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending 
    algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for 
    transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending 
    methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to 
    represent the most difficult cases for systems with small planet-to-star 
    radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to 
    determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the 
    ideal method is a time-windowed slider with an iterative robust location 
    estimator based on Tukey's biweight. This method recovers 99\% and 94\% of 
    the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an 
    additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude

A background sky flux is estimated from {\textasciitilde}4500 pixels on each of the 84 CCD readout channels, and simple aperture photometry is performed on an optimal aperture for each star. Ancillary engineering data and diagnostic information extracted from the science data are used to remove systematic errors in the flux time series that are correlated with these data prior to searching for signatures of transiting planets with a wavelet-based, adaptive matched filter. Stars with signatures exceeding 7.1σ are subjected to a
suite of statistical tests including an examination of each star's centroid motion to reject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries. Physical parameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature, and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residual light curve.

	abstract = {During its two year prime mission the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will perform a time-series photometric survey covering over 80\% of the sky. This survey comprises observations of 26 24 x 96 degree sectors that are each monitored continuously for approximately 27 days. The main goal of TESS is to find transiting planets around 200,000 pre-selected stars for which fixed aperture photometry is recorded every two minutes. However, TESS is also recording and delivering Full-Frame Images (FFIs) of each detector at a 30 minute cadence. We have created an open-source tool, eleanor, to produce light curves for objects in the TESS FFIs. Here, we describe the methods used in eleanor to produce light curves that are optimized for planet searches. The tool performs background subtraction, aperture and PSF photometry, decorrelation of instrument systematics, and cotrending using principal component analysis. We recover known transiting exoplanets in the FFIs to validate the pipeline and perform a limited search for new planet candidates in Sector 1. Our tests indicate that eleanor produces light curves with significantly less scatter than other tools that have been used in the literature. Cadence-stacked images, and raw and detrended eleanor light curves for each analyzed star will be hosted on MAST, with planet candidates on ExoFOP-TESS as Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs). This work confirms the promise that the TESS FFIs will enable the detection of thousands of new exoplanets and a broad range of time domain astrophysics.},

The detection of a statistically significant sample of planets around young stars allows us to study the early stages of planet formation and evolution, but only a handful of them is known so far. In this regard, a considerable contribution is expected from the NASA TESS satellite, which is now performing a survey of \${\textbackslash}sim 85 {\textbackslash}\%\$ of the sky to search for short-period transiting planets In its first month of operations, TESS found a planet candidate with an orbital period of 8.14 days around a member of the Tuc-Hor young association (\${\textbackslash}sim\$ 40 Myr), the G6V main component of the binary system DS{\textbackslash},Tuc. If confirmed, it would be the first transiting planet around a young star suitable for radial velocity and/or atmospheric characterization. We aim to validate the planetary nature of this companion and to measure its orbital and physical parameters. We obtain accurate planet parameters by coupling an independent reprocessing of the TESS light curve with improved stellar parameters and the dilution caused by the binary companion; we analyse high precision archival radial velocities to impose an upper limit of 0.94 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ on the planet mass; we finally rule out the presence of external companions beyond 40 au with adaptive optics images. We confirm the presence of a young, giant (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm R\} = 0.50\$ R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$) and possibly inflated planet (having a theoretical mass lower than 20 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) around DS{\textbackslash},Tuc A.

The OC population is often considered to be complete within 1.8 kpc of the Sun. The recent Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) allows the latter claim to be challenged. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We perform a systematic search for new OCs in the direction of Perseus using precise and accurate astrometry from Gaia DR2. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We implemented a coarse-to-fine search method. First, we exploited spatial proximity using a fast density-aware partitioning of the sky via a k-d tree in the spatial domain of Galactic coordinates, (l, b). Secondly, we employed a Gaussian mixture model in the proper motion space to tag fields quickly around OC candidates. Thirdly, we applied an unsupervised membership assignment method, UPMASK, to scrutinise the candidates. We visually inspected colour-magnitude diagrams to validate the detected objects. Finally, we performed a diagnostic to quantify the significance of each identified over-density in proper motion and in parallax space. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We report the discovery of 41 new stellar clusters. This represents an increment of at least 20\% of the previously known OC population in this volume of the Milky Way. We also report on the clear identification of NGC 886, an object previously considered an asterism. This study challenges the previous claim of a near-complete sample of OCs up to 1.8 kpc. Our results reveal that this claim requires revision, and a complete census of nearby OCs is yet to be found.

While hot Jupiters have been previously reported around young stars, those planets are non-transiting and near-term atmospheric characterization is not feasible. The V1298 Tau system is a compelling target for follow-up study through transmission spectroscopy and Doppler tomography owing to the transit depth (0.5{\textbackslash}\%), host star brightness (\$K\_s\$ = 8.1 mag), and rapid stellar rotation (\$v{\textbackslash}sin\{i\}\$ = 23 {\textbackslash}kms). Although the planet is Jupiter-sized, its mass is presently unknown due to high-amplitude radial velocity jitter. Nevertheless, V1298 Tau b may help constrain formation scenarios for at least one class of close-in exoplanets, providing a window into the nascent evolution of planetary interiors and atmospheres.},

The repurposed Kepler mission K2 is providing the first sample of young transiting planets by observing populations of stars in nearby, young clusters or stellar associations. We report the detection and confirmation of two planets transiting EPIC 211964830, an M2.5 dwarf in the 650 Myr old Praesepe open cluster. Using our notch-filter search method on the K2 lightcurve, we identify planets with periods of 5.84 d and 19.66 d. This is currently the second known multi-transit system in open clusters younger than 1 Gyr. The inner planet has a radius of 2.27\$\_\{-0.16\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.20\}\$ R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and the outer planet has a radius of 2.77\$\_\{-0.18\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.20\}\$ R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. Both planets are likely mini-Neptunes. These planets are expected to produce radial velocity signals of 3.4 and 2.7 m/s respectively, which is smaller than the expected stellar variability in the optical (\${\textbackslash}simeq\$30{\textbackslash},m/s), making mass measurements unlikely in the optical, but possible with future near-infrared spectrographs. We use an injection-recovery test to place robust limits on additional planets in the system, and find that planets larger than 1-2 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ with periods of 1-20 d are unlikely, while planets larger than 2 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ are ruled out at periods of 20-30 d.},

Recently, significant progress detecting transiting planets in young open clusters has been made with the K2 mission, but so far all of these transiting cluster planets orbit close to their host stars, so planet evolution can only be studied in a high-irradiation regime. Here, we report the discovery of a long-period planet candidate, called HD 283869 b, orbiting a member of the Hyades cluster. Using data from the K2 mission, we detected a single transit of a super-Earth-sized (1.96 +/- 0.12 R\_earth) planet candidate orbiting the K-dwarf HD 283869 with a period longer than 72 days. Since we only detected a single transit event, we cannot validate HD 283869 b with high confidence, but our analysis of the K2 images, archival data, and follow-up observations suggests that the source of the event is indeed a transiting planet. We estimated the candidate's orbital parameters and find that if real, it has a period P{\textasciitilde}100 days and receives approximately Earth-like incident flux, giving the candidate a 71\% chance of falling within the circumstellar habitable zone. If confirmed, HD 283869 b would have the longest orbital period, lowest incident flux, and brightest host star of any known transiting planet in an open cluster, making it uniquely important to future studies of how stellar irradiation affects planetary evolution.},

a few planets have so far been discovered. The Kepler spacecraft
revealed an abundance of small planets around small cool stars,
therefore, such cluster members are prime targets for exoplanet transit
searches. Kepler's new mission, K2, is targeting several open clusters
and star-forming regions around the ecliptic to search for transiting
planets around their low-mass constituents. Here, we report the
discovery of the first transiting planet in the intermediate-age (800
Myr) Beehive cluster (Praesepe). K2-95 is a faint (K\{\{p\}\}=15.5 \{mag\})
\{\{M\}\}3.0+/- 0.5 dwarf from K2's Campaign 5 with an effective temperature
of 3471+/- 124 \{\{K\}\}, approximately solar metallicity and a radius of

medium/high-resolution spectroscopy, adaptive optics/speckle imaging,
and archival survey images to rule out any false-positive detection
scenarios, validate the planet, and further characterize the system. The
planet’s radius is very unusual as M-dwarf field stars rarely have
Neptune-sized transiting planets. The comparatively large radius of
K2-95b is consistent with the other recently discovered cluster planets
K2-25b (Hyades) and K2-33b (Upper Scorpius), indicating systematic
differences in their evolutionary states or formation. These discoveries
from K2 provide a snapshot of planet formation and evolution in cluster
environments and thus make excellent laboratories to test differences

We present the results of a seven-year-long radial velocity survey of a sample of 88 main-sequence and evolved stars to reveal signatures of Jupiter-mass planets in the solar-age and solar-metallicity open cluster M 67. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim at studying the frequency of giant planets in this cluster with respect to the field stars. In addition, our sample is also ideal to perform a long-term study to compare the chemical composition of stars with and without giant planets in detail. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We analyzed precise radial velocity (RV) measurements obtained with the HARPS spectrograph at the European Southern Observatory (La Silla), the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France), the HRS spectrograph at the Hobby Eberly Telescope (Texas), and the HARPS-N spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (La Palma). Additional RV data come from the CORALIE spectrograph at the Euler Swiss Telescope (La Silla). We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the occurrence rate of giant planets in our radial velocity survey. We considered orbital periods between 1.0 day and 1000 days and planet masses between 0.2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and 10.0 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We used a measure of the observational detection efficiency to determine the frequency of planets for each star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: All the planets previously announced in this RV campaign with their properties are summarized here: 3 hot Jupiters around the main-sequence stars YBP1194, YBP1514, and YBP401, and 1 giant planet around the evolved star S364. Two additional planet candidates around the stars YBP778 and S978 are also analyzed in the present work. We discuss stars that exhibit large RV variability or trends individually. For 2 additional stars, long-term trends are compatible with new binary candidates or substellar objects, which increases the total number of binary candidates detected in our campaign to 14. Based on the Doppler-detected planets discovered in this survey, we find an occurrence of giant planets of 18.0{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+12.0{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-8.0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in the selected period-mass range. This frequency is slightly higher but consistent within the errors with the estimate for the field stars, which leads to the general conclusion that open cluster and field statistics agree. However, we find that the rate of hot Jupiters in the cluster ( 5.7{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+5.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-3.0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\%) is substantially higher than in the field. Based on observations collected at the ESO 3.6m telescope (La Silla), at the 1.93 m telescope of the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP, France), at the Hobby Eberly Telescope (HET, Texas), at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma) and at the Euler Swiss Telescope (La Silla).Individual RV measurements are available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} ({\textless}A href="http://130.79.128.5"{\textgreater}http://130.79.128.5{\textless}/A{\textgreater}) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/603/A85"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/603/A85{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

We confirm the planet's existence with a direct detection of CO in the planet's atmosphere. We also calculate a mass of 11.6 M\$\_J\$ based on the amplitude of its radial velocity variations. We estimate its flux contrast with its host star to get an absolute magnitude estimate for the planet of 8.17 in the K band. This magnitude implies the planet formed via a "hot start" formation mechanism. This makes CI Tau b the youngest confirmed exoplanet as well as the first exoplanet around a T Tauri star with a directly determined, model-independent, dynamical mass.},

	abstract = {The ∼2 Myr old classical T Tauri star CI Tau shows periodic variability in its radial velocity (RV) variations measured at infrared (IR) and optical wavelengths. We find that these observations are consistent with a massive planet in a ∼9 day period orbit. These results are based on 71 IR RV measurements of this system obtained over five years, and on 26 optical RV measurements obtained over nine years. CI Tau was also observed photometrically in the optical on 34 nights over ∼one month in 2012. The optical RV data alone are inadequate to identify an orbital period, likely the result of star spot and activity-induced noise for this relatively small data set. The infrared RV measurements reveal significant periodicity at ∼9 days. In addition, the full set of optical and IR RV measurements taken together phase coherently and with equal amplitudes to the ∼9 day period. Periodic RV signals can in principle be produced by cool spots, hotspots, and reflection of the stellar spectrum off the inner disk, in addition to resulting from a planetary companion. We have considered each of these and find the planet hypothesis most consistent with the data. The RV amplitude yields an of ∼8.1 M Jup; in conjunction with a 1.3 mm continuum emission measurement of the circumstellar disk inclination from the literature, we find a planet mass of ∼11.3 M Jup, assuming alignment of the planetary orbit with the disk.},

The rotation rates of all cool stars decrease substantially with time as the stars steadily lose their angular momenta. If properly calibrated, rotation therefore can act as a reliable determinant of their ages based on the method of gyrochronology. To calibrate gyrochronology, the relationship between rotation period and age must be determined for cool stars of different masses, which is best accomplished with rotation period measurements for stars in clusters with well-known ages. Hitherto, such measurements have been possible only in clusters with ages of less than about one billion years, and gyrochronology ages for older stars have been inferred from model predictions. Here we report rotation period measurements for 30 cool stars in the 2.5-billion-year-old cluster NGC 6819. The periods reveal a well-defined relationship between rotation period and stellar mass at the cluster age, suggesting that ages with a precision of order 10 per cent can be derived for large numbers of cool Galactic field stars.},

	abstract = {Rotation periods are increasingly being used to derive ages for cool single field stars. Such ages are based on an empirical understanding of how cool stars spin down, acquired by constructing color-period diagrams (CPDs) for a series of open clusters. Our main aims here are to construct a CPD for M 48, to compare this with other clusters of similar age to check for consistency, and to derive a rotational age for M 48 using gyrochronology. We monitored M 48 photometrically for over 2 months with AIP's STELLA I 1.2 m telescope and the WiFSIP 4K imager in Tenerife. Light curves with 3 mmag precision for bright (V{\textasciitilde}14 mag) stars were produced and then analysed to provide rotation periods. A cluster CPD has then been constructed. We report 62 rotation periods for cool stars in M 48. The CPD displays a clear slow/I-sequence of rotating stars, similar to those seen in the 625 Myr-old Hyades and 590 Myr-old Praesepe clusters, and below both, confirming that M 48 is younger. A similar comparison with the 250 Myr-old M 34 cluster shows that M 48 is older and does not possess any fast/C-sequence G or early K stars like those in M 34, although relatively fast rotators do seem to be present among the late-K and M stars. A more detailed comparison of the CPD with rotational evolution models shows that the cluster stars have a mean age of 450 Myr, and its (rotating) stars can be individually dated to +-117 Myr (26\%). Much of this uncertainty stems from intrinsic astrophysical spread in initial periods, and almost all stars are consistent with a single age of 450 Myr. The gyro-age of M 48 as a whole is 450+-50 Myr, in agreement with the previously determined isochrone age of 400+-100 Myr.},

	abstract = {Pisces-Eridanus (Psc-Eri), a nearby (\$d\$ \${\textbackslash}simeq\$ 80-226 pc) stellar stream stretching across \${\textbackslash}approx\$120 degrees of the sky, was recently discovered with Gaia data. The stream was claimed to be \${\textbackslash}approx\$1 Gyr old, which would make it an exceptional discovery for stellar astrophysics, as star clusters of that age are rare and tend to be distant, limiting their utility as benchmark samples. We test this old age for Psc-Eri in two ways. First, we compare the rotation periods for 101 low-mass members (measured using time series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS) to those of well-studied open clusters. Second, we identify 34 new high-mass candidate members, including the notable stars \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ Tauri (an Algol-type eclipsing binary) and HD 1160 (host to a directly imaged object near the hydrogen-burning limit). We conduct an isochronal analysis of the color--magnitude data for these highest-mass members, again comparing our results to those for open clusters. Both analyses show that the stream has an age consistent with that of the Pleiades, i.e., \${\textbackslash}approx\$120 Myr. This makes the Psc-Eri stream an exciting source of young benchmarkable stars and, potentially, exoplanets located in a more diffuse environment that is distinct from that of the Pleiades and of other dense star clusters.},

Detailed Monte Carlo simulations were performed to model the datasets and calculate the expected planet yields. Seven planets were expected in 47 Tuc, and five in omega Cen. Despite a detailed search, no planet-like candidates were identified in either cluster. Combined with previous theoretical studies of planet survivability, and the HST null result in the core of 47 Tuc, the lack of detections in the uncrowded outer regions of both clusters indicates that stellar metallicity is the dominant factor inhibiting Hot Jupiter formation in the cluster environment.},

The experiment provided high-quality data sufficient to detect planets. A full analysis of these WFPC2 data reveals 75 variables, but no light curves resulted for which a convincing interpretation as a planet could be made. The planet frequency in 47 Tuc is at least an order of magnitude below that for the solar neighborhood. The cause of the absence of close-in planets in 47 Tuc is not yet known; presumably the low metallicity and/or crowding of 47 Tuc interfered with planet formation, with orbital evolution to close-in positions, or with planet survival.},

	abstract = {In the course of conducting a deep (14.5 lsim r lsim 23), 20 night 
survey for transiting planets in the rich {\textasciitilde}550 Myr old open cluster M37,
we have measured the rotation periods of 575 stars, which lie near the
cluster main sequence, with masses 0.2 M sun lsim M lsim 1.3
M sun. This is the largest sample of rotation periods for a
cluster older than 500 Myr. Using this rich sample we investigate a
number of relations between rotation period, color, and the amplitude of
photometric variability. Stars with M gsim 0.8 M sun show a
tight correlation between period and mass with heavier stars rotating
more rapidly. There is a group of four stars with P {\textgreater} 15 days that
fall well above this relation, which, if real, would present a
significant challenge to theories of stellar angular momentum evolution.
Below 0.8 M sun, the stars continue to follow the period-mass
correlation but with a broad tail of rapid rotators that expands to
shorter periods with decreasing mass. We combine these results with
observations of other open clusters to test the standard theory of lower
main-sequence stellar angular momentum evolution. We find that the model
reproduces the observations for solar-mass stars, but discrepancies are
apparent for stars with 0.6 lsim M lsim 1.0 M sun. We also
find that for late K through early M dwarf stars in this cluster, rapid
rotators tend to be bluer than slow rotators in B - V but redder than
slow rotators in V - IC . This result supports the hypothesis
that the significant discrepancy between the observed and predicted
temperatures and radii of low-mass main-sequence stars is due to stellar
activity.

	abstract = {The age of an individual star cannot be measured, only estimated through mostly model-dependent or empirical methods, and no single method works well for a broad range of stellar types or for a full range in age. This review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

We investigate the noise properties of our data, finding correlated `red' noise at the {\textasciitilde}1-1.5 mmag level in bright stars, over transit-like time-scales of 2.5h. An important source of correlated noise in aperture photometry is image blending, which produces variations correlated with the seeing. We present a simple blend index based on fitting polynomials to these variations, and find that subtracting the fit from the data provides a method to reduce their amplitude, in lieu of using techniques, such as point spread function fitting photometry, which tackle their cause. Finally, we use the SYSREM algorithm to search for any further systematic effects.},

	abstract = {The Monitor project is a photometric monitoring survey of nine young (1-200Myr) clusters in the solar neighbourhood to search for eclipses by very low mass stars and brown dwarfs and for planetary transits in the light curves of cluster members. It began in the autumn of 2004 and uses several 2- to 4-m telescopes worldwide. We aim to calibrate the relation between age, mass, radius and where possible luminosity, from the K dwarf to the planet regime, in an age range where constraints on evolutionary models are currently very scarce. Any detection of an exoplanet in one of our youngest targets ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}10Myr) would also provide important constraints on planet formation and migration time-scales and their relation to protoplanetary disc lifetimes. Finally, we will use the light curves of cluster members to study rotation and flaring in low-mass pre-main-sequence stars.
	The present paper details the motivation, science goals and observing strategy of the survey. We present a method to estimate the sensitivity and number of detections expected in each cluster, using a simple semi-analytic approach which takes into account the characteristics of the cluster and photometric observations, using (tunable) best-guess assumptions for the incidence and parameter distribution of putative companions, and we incorporate the limits imposed by radial velocity follow-up from medium and large telescopes. We use these calculations to show that the survey as a whole can be expected to detect over 100 young low and very low mass eclipsing binaries, and {\textasciitilde}3 transiting planets with radial velocity signatures detectable with currently available
facilities.},

We conduct Monte Carlo transit injection and recovery simulations to calculate the 95\% confidence upper limit on the fraction of cluster members and field stars with planets as a function of planetary radius and orbital period.

The CubeFactory class creates a large image cube from a list of FFI files, which allows the cutout operation to be performed efficiently. The CutoutFactory class performs the actual cutout and builds a target pixel file (TPF) that is compatible with TESS pipeline TPFs. Because this software operates on TESS mission-produced FFIs, the resulting TPFs are not background-subtracted.

    abstract = {Context. Transit surveys, both ground- and space-based, have 
    already accumulated a large number of light curves that span several 
    years. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The search for transiting 
    planets in these long time series is computationally intensive. We wish to 
    optimize the search for both detection and computational efficiencies. 
    {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We assume that the searched systems 
    can be described well by Keplerian orbits. We then propagate the effects 
    of different system parameters to the detection parameters. {\textless}BR 
    /{\textgreater} Results: We show that the frequency information content of 
    the light curve is primarily determined by the duty cycle of the transit 
    signal, and thus the optimal frequency sampling is found to be cubic and 
    not linear. Further optimization is achieved by considering duty-cycle 
    dependent binning of the phased light curve. By using the (standard) BLS, 
    one is either fairly insensitive to long-period planets or less sensitive 
    to short-period planets and computationally slower by a significant factor 
    of {\textasciitilde}330 (for a 3 yr long dataset). We also show how the 
    physical system parameters, such as the host star's size and mass, 
    directly affect transit detection. This understanding can then be used to 
    optimize the search for every star individually. {\textless}BR 
    /{\textgreater} Conclusions: By considering Keplerian dynamics explicitly

    abstract = {We present a new method to detect planetary transits from 
    time-series photometry, the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm. TLS 
    searches for transit-like features while taking the stellar limb darkening 
    and planetary ingress and egress into account. We have optimized TLS for 
    both signal detection efficiency (SDE) of small planets and computational 
    speed. TLS analyses the entire, unbinned phase-folded light curve. We 
    compensate for the higher computational load by (i.) using algorithms like 
    "Mergesort" (for the trial orbital phases) and by (ii.) restricting the 
    trial transit durations to a smaller range that encompasses all known 
    planets, and using stellar density priors where available. A typical K2 
    light curve, including 80d of observations at a cadence of 30min, can be 
    searched with TLS in {\textasciitilde}10s real time on a standard laptop 
    computer, as fast as the widely used Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm. We 
    perform a transit injection-retrieval experiment of Earth-sized planets 
    around sun-like stars using synthetic light curves with 110ppm white noise 
    per 30min cadence, corresponding to a photometrically quiet KP=12 star 
    observed with Kepler. We determine the SDE thresholds for both BLS and TLS 
    to reach a false positive rate of 1\% to be SDE{\textasciitilde}7 in both 
    cases. The resulting true positive (or recovery) rates are 
    {\textasciitilde}93\% for TLS and {\textasciitilde}76\% for BLS, implying 
    more reliable detections with TLS. We also test TLS with the K2 light 
    curve of the TRAPPIST-1 system and find six of seven Earth-sized planets 
    using an iterative search for increasingly lower signal detection 
    efficiency, the phase-folded transit of the seventh planet being affected 
    by a stellar flare. TLS is more reliable than BLS in finding any kind of 
    transiting planet but it is particularly suited for the detection of small 
    planets in long time series from Kepler, TESS, and PLATO. We make our 
    Python implementation of TLS publicly available.},

	abstract = {As the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve, the precision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limited not by the data themselves, but by the manner, standard, and uniformity with which time itself is referenced. While some areas of astronomy (most notably pulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of considerably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have crossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have found that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups can differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be mistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We argue that, since the commonly-used Julian Date, as well as its heliocentric and barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it is imperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1 minute are required. We summarize the rationale behind our recommendation to quote the site arrival time, in addition to using BJD\_TDB, the Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time standard for any astrophysical event. The BJD\_TDB is the most practical absolute time stamp for extra-terrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of the target system. We compile a general summary of factors that must be considered in order to achieve timing precisions ranging from 15 minutes to 1 microsecond. Finally, we provide software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculate BJD\_TDB to a precision of 1 microsecond for any target from anywhere on Earth or from any spacecraft.},

    abstract = {Difference imaging or image subtraction is a method that 
    measures differential photometry by matching the pointing and point-spread 
    function (PSF) between image frames. It is used for the detection of 
    time-variable phenomena. Here we present a new category of method---CPM 
    Difference Imaging, in which differences are not measured between matched 
    images but instead between image frames and a data-driven predictive model 
    that has been designed only to predict the pointing, PSF, and detector 
    effects but not astronomical variability. In CPM Difference Imaging each 
    pixel is modelled by the Causal Pixel Model (CPM) originally built for 
    modeling Kepler data, in which pixel values are predicted by a linear 
    combination of other pixels at the same epoch but far enough away such 
    that these pixels are causally disconnected, astrophysically. It does not 
    require that the user have any explicit model or description of the 
    pointing or point-spread function of any of the images. Its principal 
    drawback is that---in its current form---it requires an imaging campaign 
    with many epochs and fairly stable telescope pointing. The method is 
    applied to simulated data and also the K2 Campaign 9 microlensing data. We 
    show that CPM Difference Imaging can detect variable objects and produce 
    precise differentiate photometry in a crowded field. CPM Difference 
    Imaging is capable of producing image differences at nearly photon-noise

Unlike the standard DIA technique which involves modelling the kernel as a linear combination of basis functions, we consider the kernel as a discrete pixel array and solve for the kernel pixel values directly using linear least squares. The removal of basis functions from the kernel model is advantageous for a number of
	compelling reasons. First, it removes the need for the user to specify such functions, which makes for a much simpler user application and avoids the risk of an inappropriate choice. Secondly, basis functions are constructed around the origin of the kernel coordinate system, which requires that the two images are perfectly aligned for an optimal result. The pixel kernel model is sufficiently flexible to correct for image misalignments, and in the case of a simple translation between images, image resampling becomes unnecessary. Our new algorithm can be extended to spatially varying kernels by solving for individual pixel kernels in a grid of image subregions and interpolating the solutions to obtain the kernel at any one pixel.},

	abstract = {We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the Gaia mission (Gaia DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500 pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, G-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards l, b ̃ 218.5° , - 2°, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.

spectroscopic survey for new (predominantly M type) members of the group after combining kinematic and photometric data to select candidates with Galactic space motion and positions in colour-magnitude space consistent with membership. We identify 30 new members, increasing the number of known 32 Ori group members by a factor of 3 and bringing the total number of identified members to 46, spanning spectral types B5 to L1. We also identify the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) of the group, I.e. the luminosity at which lithium remains unburnt in a coeval population. We estimate the age of the 32 Ori group independently using both isochronal fitting and LDB analyses and find it is essentially coeval with the β Pictoris moving group, with an age of 24 ± 4 Myr.
Finally, we have also searched for circumstellar disc hosts utilizing the AllWISE catalogue. Although we find no evidence for warm, dusty discs, we identify several stars with excess emission in the WISE W4 band at 22 μm. Based on the limited number of W4 detections, we
estimate a debris disc fraction of 32{\textasciicircum}\{+12\}\_\{-8\} per cent for the 32 Ori group.},

	abstract = {The primary sample of the Gaia Data Release 1 is the Tycho- Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS): ≈2 million Tycho-2 sources with improved parallaxes and proper motions relative to the initial catalog. This increased astrometric precision presents an opportunity to find new binary stars and moving groups. We search for high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS by identifying pairs of stars consistent with having the same 3D velocity using a marginalized likelihood ratio test to discriminate candidate comoving pairs from the field population. Although we perform some visualizations using (bias-corrected) inverse parallax as a point estimate of distance, the likelihood ratio is computed with a probabilistic model that includes the covariances of parallax and proper motions and marginalizes the (unknown) true distances and 3D velocities of the stars. We find 13,085 comoving star pairs among 10,606 unique stars with separations as large as 10 pc (our search limit). Some of these pairs form larger groups through mutual comoving neighbors: many of these pair networks correspond to known open clusters and OB associations, but we also report the discovery of several new comoving groups. Most surprisingly, we find a large number of very wide ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/6/257/ajaa6ffdieqn1.gif] \${\textbackslash}gt 1\$ pc) separation comoving star pairs, the number of which increases with increasing separation and cannot be explained purely by false-positive contamination. Our key result is a catalog of high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS. We discuss the utility of this catalog for making dynamical inferences about the Galaxy, testing stellar atmosphere models, and validating chemical abundance measurements.},

	abstract = {We report the selection and spectroscopic confirmation of 129 new late-type (SpT = K3-M6) members of the Tucana-Horologium moving group, a nearby (d {\textasciitilde} 40 pc), young (τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr) population of comoving stars. We also report observations for 13 of the 17 known Tuc-Hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67\%. We have used radial velocities, Hα emission, and Li6708 absorption to distinguish
between contaminants and bona fide members. Our expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known population by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 in total and by a factor of {\textasciitilde}8 for members with SpT {\textgreater}= K3, but even so, the K-M dwarf population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. Our expanded census allows for a much more detailed study of Tuc-Hor than was previously feasible. The spatial distribution of members appears to trace a two-dimensional sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but a very narrow distribution (±5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity
distribution is very small, with a scatter of ±1.1 km
s-1 about the mean UVW velocity for stars spanning the entire 50 pc extent of Tuc-Hor. We also show that the isochronal age (τ {\textasciitilde} 20-30 Myr) and the lithium depletion boundary age (τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr)
disagree, following the trend in other pre-main-sequence populations for isochrones to yield systematically younger ages. The Hα emission line strength follows a trend of increasing equivalent width with later spectral type, as is seen for young clusters. We find that moving group members have been depleted of measurable lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. None of our targets have significant infrared excesses in the WISE W3 band, yielding an upper limit on warm debris disks of F {\textless} 0.7\%. Finally, our purely kinematic and color-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for
activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60\% of K-M dwarfs in Tuc-Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would have been omitted in X-ray-selected samples. In contrast, GALEX UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for youth achieve completeness of 77\% and purity of 78\%, and we suggest new SpT-dependent selection criteria that will yield {\textgreater}95\% completeness for τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr populations with
GALEX data available.},

	abstract = {BANYAN Σ is a new Bayesian algorithm to identify members of young 
stellar associations within 150 pc of the Sun. It includes 27 young
associations with ages in the range ˜1-800 Myr, modeled with
multivariate Gaussians in six-dimensional (6D) XYZUVW space. It is the
first such multi-association classification tool to include the nearest
sub-groups of the Sco-Cen OB star-forming region, the IC 2602, IC 2391,
Pleiades and Platais 8 clusters, and the ρ Ophiuchi, Corona
Australis, and Taurus star formation regions. A model of field stars is
built from a mixture of multivariate Gaussians based on the
Besançon Galactic model. The algorithm can derive membership
probabilities for objects with only sky coordinates and proper motion,
but can also include parallax and radial velocity measurements, as well
as spectrophotometric distance constraints from sequences in
color-magnitude or spectral type-magnitude diagrams. BANYAN
Σ benefits from an analytical solution to the Bayesian
marginalization integrals over unknown radial velocities and distances
that makes it more accurate and significantly faster than its
predecessor BANYAN II. A contamination versus hit rate analysis is
presented and demonstrates that BANYAN Σ achieves a better
classification performance than other moving group tools available in
the literature, especially in terms of cross-contamination between young
associations. An updated list of bona fide members in the 27 young
associations, augmented by the Gaia-DR1 release, as well as all
parameters for the 6D multivariate Gaussian models for each association
and the Galactic field neighborhood within 300 pc are presented. This
new tool will make it possible to analyze large data sets such as the
upcoming Gaia-DR2 to identify new young stars. IDL and Python versions
of BANYAN Σ are made available with this publication, and a more
limited online web tool is available at http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/banyan/banyansigma.php.},

statistical method in a modified fashion. In this study, we applied a
global optimization procedure to fit the observed distribution of proper
motions with two overlapping normal bivariate frequency functions, which
also take the individual proper motion errors into account. For 724
clusters, this is the first determination of proper motion, and for the
whole sample, we present results with a much larger number of identified
astrometric member stars. Furthermore, it was possible to estimate the
mean radial velocity of 364 clusters (102 unpublished so far) with the
stellar membership using published radial velocity catalogs. These
results provide an increase of 30\% and 19\% in the sample of open
clusters with a determined mean absolute proper motion and mean radial
velocity, respectively.

	abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 provides high-precision astrometry and three-band photometry for about 1.3 billion sources over the full sky. The precision, accuracy, and homogeneity of both astrometry and photometry are unprecedented. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We highlight the power of the Gaia DR2 in studying many fine structures of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many different HRDs, depending in particular on stellar population selections. We do not aim here for completeness in terms of types of stars or stellar evolutionary aspects. Instead, we have chosen several illustrative examples. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We describe some of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity, and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar populations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated. Two different populations in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously identified in the HRD. Membership and mean parameters for a selected list of open clusters are provided. They allow drawing very detailed cluster sequences, highlighting fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will lead to more insight in stellar physics. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential of combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for studies in stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire new area for HRD-based studies.

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Open clusters are convenient probes of the structure and history of the Galactic disk. They are also fundamental to stellar evolution studies. The second {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data release contains precise astrometry at the submilliarcsecond level and homogeneous photometry at the mmag level, that can be used to characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In this study we aim to establish a list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data alone.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We compiled a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature. We then applied an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We obtained a list of members and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 astrometry, the fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to date. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 60 new open clusters in the fields analysed during this study.},

	abstract = {The two reaction wheel K2 mission promises and has delivered new discoveries in the stellar and exoplanet fields. However, due to the loss of accurate pointing, it also brings new challenges for the data reduction processes. In this paper, we describe a new reduction pipeline for extracting high-precision photometry from the K2 data set, and present public light curves for the K2 Campaign 1 target pixel data set. Key to our reduction is the derivation of global astrometric solutions from the target stamps, from which accurate centroids are passed on for high-precision photometry extraction. We extract target light curves for sources from a combined UCAC4 and EPIC catalogue - this includes not only primary targets of the K2 campaign 1, but also any other stars that happen to fall on the pixel stamps. We provide the raw light curves, and the products of various detrending processes aimed at removing different types of systematics. Our astrometric solutions achieve a median residual of ˜0.127 arcsec. For bright stars, our best 6.5 h
precision for raw light curves is ˜20 parts per million (ppm). For our detrended light curves, the best 6.5 h precision achieved is ˜15 ppm. We show that our detrended light curves have fewer
systematic effects (or trends, or red-noise) than light curves produced by other groups from the same observations. Example light curves of transiting planets and a Cepheid variable candidate, are also presented. We make all light curves public, including the raw and detrended photometry, at http://k2.hatsurveys.org.},

	abstract = {Ground-based exoplanet surveys such as SuperWASP, HAT Network of Telescopes (HATNet), and KELT have discovered close to two hundred transiting extrasolar planets in the past several years. The strategy of these surveys is to look at a large field of view and measure the brightnesses of its bright stars to around half a percent per point precision, which is adequate for detecting hot Jupiters. Typically, these surveys use CCD detectors to achieve high precision photometry. These CCDS, however, are expensive relative to other consumer-grade optical imaging devices, such as digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs). We look at the possibility of using a DSLR camera for precision photometry. Specifically, we used a Canon EOS 60D camera that records light in three colors simultaneously. The DSLR was integrated into the HATNet survey and collected observations for a month, after which photometry was extracted for 6600 stars in a selected stellar field. We found that the DSLR achieves a best-case median absolute deviation of 4.6 mmag per 180 s exposure when the DSLR color channels are combined, and 1000 stars are measured to better than 10 mmag (1\%). Also, we achieve 10 mmag or better photometry in the individual colors. This is good enough to detect transiting hot Jupiters. We performed a candidate search on all stars and found four candidates, one of which is KELT-3b, the only known transiting hot Jupiter in our selected field. We conclude that the Canon 60D is a cheap, lightweight device capable of useful photometry in multiple colors.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
	scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
	international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
	subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
	spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.

Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
	Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
	products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and
	GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our
implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort. The code is available online at http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the GNU General Public License v2.},

In the limit that the planet radius is less than a tenth of the stellar radius, we show that the exact lightcurve can be well approximated by assuming the region of the star blocked by the planet has constant surface brightness. We apply these results to the HST observations of HD 209458, showing that the ratio of the planetary to stellar radii is 0.1207+-0.0003. These formulae give a fast and accurate means of computing lightcurves using limb-darkening coefficients from model atmospheres which should aid in the detection, simulation, and parameter fitting of planetary transits.},

	abstract = {We present new gravity and limb-darkening coefficients for a wide range of effective temperatures, gravities, metallicities, and microturbulent velocities. These coefficients can be used in many different fields of stellar physics as synthetic light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits, stellar diameters, line profiles in rotating stars, and others. The limb-darkening coefficients were computed specifically for the photometric system of the space mission TESS and were performed by adopting the least-square method. In addition, the linear and bi-parametric coefficients, by adopting the flux conservation method, are also available. On the other hand, to take into account the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we computed the passband gravity-darkening coefficients \$y({\textbackslash}lambda)\$ using a general differential equation in which we consider the effects of convection and of the partial derivative \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln I({\textbackslash}lambda)\}/\{{\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln g\}\}{\textbackslash}right)\_\{T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\}\$. To generate the limb-darkening coefficients we adopt two stellar atmosphere models: ATLAS (plane-parallel) and PHOENIX (spherical, quasi-spherical, and \$r\$-method). The specific intensity distribution was fitted using five approaches: linear, quadratic, square root, logarithmic, and a more general one with four terms. These grids cover together 19 metallicities ranging from 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ up to 10\${\textasciicircum}\{+1\}\$ solar abundances, 0 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ log g \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 6.0 and 1500 K \${\textbackslash}leq\$ T\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 50000 K.

The algorithm searches for signals characterized by a periodic alternation between two discrete levels, with much less time spent at the lower level. We present numerical as well as analytical results to predict the possible detection significance at various signal parameters. It is shown that the crucial parameter is the effective signal-to-noise ratio - the expected depth of the transit divided by the standard deviation of the measured photometric average within the transit. When this parameter exceeds the value of 6 we can expect a significant detection of the transit. We show that the box-fitting algorithm performs better than other methods available in the astronomical literature, especially for low signal-to-noise ratios.},

	abstract = {To detect objects that vary in brightness or spatial coordinates over 
time, C. Alard and R. H. Lupton in 1998 proposed an “optimal image
subtraction” (OIS) method that constructs a convolution kernel
from a set of matching stars distributed across the two images to be
subtracted. Using multivariable least squares, the kernel is derived and
can be designed to vary by pixel coordinates across the convolved image.
Local effects in the optics, including aberrations or other spatially
sensitive perturbations to a perfect image, can be mitigated. This paper
presents the specific systems of equations that originate from the OIS
method. Also included is a complete description of the Gaussian
components basis vectors used by Alard \& Lupton to construct the
convolution kernel. An alternative set of basis vectors, called the
delta function basis, is also described. Important issues are addressed,
including the selection of the matching stars, differential background
correction, constant photometric flux, contaminated pixel masking, and
alignment at the subpixel level. Computer algorithms for the OIS method
were developed, written using the Interactive Data Language (IDL), and
applications demonstrating these algorithms are presented.},

The algorithm is tailored to work efficiently on wide fields with a large number of sources and significant nonlinear distortions, as long as the distortions can be approximated with linear transformations locally over the scale length of the average distance between the points. The procedure is based on symmetric point matching in a newly defined continuous triangle space that consists of triangles generated by extended Delaunay triangulation.

While light curves will be provided for ∼400,000 targets observed at 2 minute cadence, observations of most stars will only be provided as full-frame images (FFIs) at 30 minute cadence. The TESS image scale of ∼21″/pix is highly susceptible to crowding, blending, and source confusion, and the highly spatially variable point-spread function (PSF) will challenge traditional techniques, such as aperture and Gaussian-kernel PSF photometry. We use official “End-to-End 6” TESS simulated FFIs to demonstrate a difference image analysis pipeline, using a δ -function kernel, that achieves the mission specification noise floor of 60 ppm hr −1/2 . We show that the pipeline performance does not depend on position across the field, and only ∼2\% of stars appear to exhibit residual systematics at the level of ∼5 ppt. We also demonstrate recoverability of planet transits, eclipsing binaries, and other variables. We provide the pipeline as an open-source tool at https://github.com/ryanoelkers/DIA [http://https://github.com/ryanoelkers/DIA] in both IDL and PYTHON. We intend to extract light curves for all point sources in the TESS FFIs as soon as they become publicly available, and will provide the light curves through the Filtergraph data visualization service.

	abstract = {We observed the open clusters M35 and NGC 2158 during the initial K2 
campaign (C0). Reducing these data to high-precision photometric
timeseries is challenging due to the wide point-spread function (PSF)
and the blending of stellar light in such dense regions. We developed an
image-subtraction-based K2 reduction pipeline that is applicable to both
crowded and sparse stellar fields. We applied our pipeline to the
data-rich C0 K2 super stamp, containing the two open clusters, as well
as to the neighboring postage stamps. In this paper, we present our
image subtraction reduction pipeline and demonstrate that this technique
achieves ultra-high photometric precision for sources in the C0 super
stamp. We extract the raw light curves of 3960 stars taken from the
UCAC4 and EPIC catalogs and de-trend them for systematic effects. We
compare our photometric results with the prior reductions published in
the literature. For de-trended TFA-corrected sources in the
12-12.25 \{\{\{K\}\}\}\{\{p\}\} magnitude range, we achieve a
best 6.5-hour window running rms of 35 ppm, falling to 100 ppm for
fainter stars in the 14-14.25 \{\{\{K\}\}\}\{\{p\}\} magnitude
range. For stars with \{K\}p{\textgreater} 14, our de-trended and
6.5-hour binned light curves achieve the highest photometric precision.
Moreover, all our TFA-corrected sources have higher precision on all
timescales investigated. This work represents the first published image
subtraction analysis of a K2 super stamp. This method will be
particularly useful for analyzing the Galactic bulge observations
carried out during K2 campaign 9. The raw light curves and the final
results of our de-trending processes are publicly available at http://k2.hatsurveys.org/archive/.},

The FITS Working Group of the International Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided here in its entirety. In addition to describing the new features in FITS, numerous editorial changes were made to the previous version to clarify and reorganize many of the sections. Also included are some appendices which are not formally part of the standard.

The system requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem in which nothing—not even the image scale—is known. After robust source detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a null hypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B catalog and designed for uniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is \&gt;99.9\% for contemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false positives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B catalog; augmentation with indices built from the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog brings the completeness to 100\% with no false positives. We are using this system to generate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized imaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific investigators, and hobbyists.

During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}C{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≈4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

	abstract = {Among the group of extrasolar planets, transiting planets provide a great opportunity to obtain direct measurements for the basic physical properties, such as mass and radius of these objects. These planets are therefore highly important in the understanding of the evolution and formation of planetary systems: from the observations of photometric transits, the interior structure of the planet and atmospheric properties can also be constrained. The most efficient way to search for transiting extrasolar planets is based on wide-field surveys by hunting for short and shallow periodic dips in light curves covering quite long time intervals. These surveys monitor fields with several degrees in diameter and tens or hundreds of thousands of objects simultaneously. In the practice of astronomical observations, surveys of large field-of-view are rather new and therefore require special methods for photometric data reduction that have not been used before. In this PhD thesis, I summarize my efforts related to the development of a complete software solution for high precision photometric reduction of astronomical images. I also demonstrate the role of this newly developed package and the related algorithms in the case of particular discoveries of the HATNet project. [abridged]},
