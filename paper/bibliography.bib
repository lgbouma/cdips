    abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( TESS ) will be 
    conducting a nearly all-sky photometric survey over two years, with a core 
    mission goal to discover small transiting exoplanets orbiting nearby 
    bright stars. It will obtain 30 minute cadence observations of all objects 
    in the TESS fields of view, along with two-minute cadence observations of 
    200,000–400,000 selected stars. The choice of which stars to observe at 
    the two-minute cadence is driven by the need to detect small transiting 
    planets, which leads to the selection of primarily bright, cool dwarfs. We 
    describe the catalogs assembled and the algorithms used to populate the 
    TESS Input Catalog (TIC), including plans to update the TIC with the 
    incorporation of the Gaia second data release in the near future. We also 
    describe a ranking system for prioritizing stars according to the smallest 
    transiting planet detectable, and assemble a Candidate Target List (CTL) 
    using that ranking. We discuss additional factors that affect the ability 
    to photometrically detect and dynamically confirm small planets, and we 
    note additional stellar populations of interest that may be added to the 
    final target list. The TIC is available on the STScI MAST server, and an

Astrocut performs the same cutout across all FFIs that share a common pointing to create a time series of images on a small portion of the sky. The Astrocut package has two parts: the CubeFactory and the CutoutFactory. The CubeFactory class creates a large image cube from a list of FFI files, which allows the cutout operation to be performed efficiently. The CutoutFactory class performs the actual cutout and builds a target pixel file (TPF) that is compatible with TESS pipeline TPFs. Because this software operates on TESS mission-produced FFIs, the resulting TPFs are not background-subtracted. In addition to the Astrocut software itself, the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) provides a cutout service, TESScut, which runs Astrocut on MAST servers, and allows users to simply request cutouts through a web form or direct HTTP API query.},

    abstract = {Context. Transit surveys, both ground- and space-based, have 
    already accumulated a large number of light curves that span several 
    years. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The search for transiting 
    planets in these long time series is computationally intensive. We wish to 
    optimize the search for both detection and computational efficiencies. 
    {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We assume that the searched systems 
    can be described well by Keplerian orbits. We then propagate the effects 
    of different system parameters to the detection parameters. {\textless}BR 
    /{\textgreater} Results: We show that the frequency information content of 
    the light curve is primarily determined by the duty cycle of the transit 
    signal, and thus the optimal frequency sampling is found to be cubic and 
    not linear. Further optimization is achieved by considering duty-cycle 
    dependent binning of the phased light curve. By using the (standard) BLS, 
    one is either fairly insensitive to long-period planets or less sensitive 
    to short-period planets and computationally slower by a significant factor 
    of {\textasciitilde}330 (for a 3 yr long dataset). We also show how the 
    physical system parameters, such as the host star's size and mass, 
    directly affect transit detection. This understanding can then be used to 
    optimize the search for every star individually. {\textless}BR 
    /{\textgreater} Conclusions: By considering Keplerian dynamics explicitly 
    rather than implicitly one can optimally search the BLS parameter space. 
    The presented Optimal BLS enhances the detectability of both very short 
    and very long period planets, while allowing such searches to be done with 
    much reduced resources and time. The Matlab/Octave source code for Optimal 
    BLS is made available. The MATLAB code is only available at the CDS via

    abstract = {We present a new method to detect planetary transits from 
    time-series photometry, the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm. TLS 
    searches for transit-like features while taking the stellar limb darkening 
    and planetary ingress and egress into account. We have optimized TLS for 
    both signal detection efficiency (SDE) of small planets and computational 
    speed. TLS analyses the entire, unbinned phase-folded light curve. We 
    compensate for the higher computational load by (i.) using algorithms like 
    "Mergesort" (for the trial orbital phases) and by (ii.) restricting the 
    trial transit durations to a smaller range that encompasses all known 
    planets, and using stellar density priors where available. A typical K2 
    light curve, including 80d of observations at a cadence of 30min, can be 
    searched with TLS in {\textasciitilde}10s real time on a standard laptop 
    computer, as fast as the widely used Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm. We 
    perform a transit injection-retrieval experiment of Earth-sized planets 
    around sun-like stars using synthetic light curves with 110ppm white noise 
    per 30min cadence, corresponding to a photometrically quiet KP=12 star 
    observed with Kepler. We determine the SDE thresholds for both BLS and TLS 
    to reach a false positive rate of 1\% to be SDE{\textasciitilde}7 in both 
    cases. The resulting true positive (or recovery) rates are 
    {\textasciitilde}93\% for TLS and {\textasciitilde}76\% for BLS, implying 
    more reliable detections with TLS. We also test TLS with the K2 light 
    curve of the TRAPPIST-1 system and find six of seven Earth-sized planets 
    using an iterative search for increasingly lower signal detection 
    efficiency, the phase-folded transit of the seventh planet being affected 
    by a stellar flare. TLS is more reliable than BLS in finding any kind of 
    transiting planet but it is particularly suited for the detection of small 
    planets in long time series from Kepler, TESS, and PLATO. We make our 
    Python implementation of TLS publicly available.},

	abstract = {As the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve, the precision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limited not by the data themselves, but by the manner, standard, and uniformity with which time itself is referenced. While some areas of astronomy (most notably pulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of considerably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have crossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have found that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups can differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be mistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We argue that, since the commonly-used Julian Date, as well as its heliocentric and barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it is imperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1 minute are required. We summarize the rationale behind our recommendation to quote the site arrival time, in addition to using BJD\_TDB, the Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time standard for any astrophysical event. The BJD\_TDB is the most practical absolute time stamp for extra-terrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of the target system. We compile a general summary of factors that must be considered in order to achieve timing precisions ranging from 15 minutes to 1 microsecond. Finally, we provide software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculate BJD\_TDB to a precision of 1 microsecond for any target from anywhere on Earth or from any spacecraft.},

    abstract = {Difference imaging or image subtraction is a method that 
    measures differential photometry by matching the pointing and point-spread 
    function (PSF) between image frames. It is used for the detection of 
    time-variable phenomena. Here we present a new category of method---CPM 
    Difference Imaging, in which differences are not measured between matched 
    images but instead between image frames and a data-driven predictive model 
    that has been designed only to predict the pointing, PSF, and detector 
    effects but not astronomical variability. In CPM Difference Imaging each 
    pixel is modelled by the Causal Pixel Model (CPM) originally built for 
    modeling Kepler data, in which pixel values are predicted by a linear 
    combination of other pixels at the same epoch but far enough away such 
    that these pixels are causally disconnected, astrophysically. It does not 
    require that the user have any explicit model or description of the

Unlike the standard DIA technique which involves modelling the kernel as a linear combination of basis functions, we consider the kernel as a discrete pixel array and solve for the kernel pixel values directly using linear least squares. The removal of basis functions from the kernel model is advantageous for a number of
	compelling reasons. First, it removes the need for the user to specify such functions, which makes for a much simpler user application and avoids the risk of an inappropriate choice. Secondly, basis functions are constructed around the origin of the kernel coordinate system, which requires that the two images are perfectly aligned for an optimal result. The pixel kernel model is sufficiently flexible to correct for image misalignments, and in the case of a simple translation between images, image resampling becomes unnecessary. Our new algorithm can be extended to spatially varying kernels by solving for individual pixel kernels in a grid of image subregions and interpolating the solutions to obtain the kernel at any one pixel.},

	abstract = {We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the Gaia mission (Gaia DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500 pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, G-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards l, b ̃ 218.5° , - 2°, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.

The tidal radius is about 9 pc, and 275 {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (364 systems) are gravitationally bound.

Strong mass segregation is inherent in the cluster. The present-day luminosity and mass functions are noticeably different in various parts of the cluster (core, corona, halo, and co-movers). They are strongly evolved compared to presently favoured initial mass functions. The analysis of the velocity dispersion of the cluster shows that about 20\% of its members must be binaries. As a by-product, we find that presently available theoretical isochrones are not able to adequately describe the near-infrared colour-absolute magnitude relation for those cluster stars that are less massive than about 0.6 {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}.},

spectroscopic survey for new (predominantly M type) members of the group after combining kinematic and photometric data to select candidates with Galactic space motion and positions in colour-magnitude space consistent with membership. We identify 30 new members, increasing the number of known 32 Ori group members by a factor of 3 and bringing the total number of identified members to 46, spanning spectral types B5 to L1. We also identify the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) of the group, I.e. the luminosity at which lithium remains unburnt in a coeval population. We estimate the age of the 32 Ori group independently using both isochronal fitting and LDB analyses and find it is essentially coeval with the β Pictoris moving group, with an age of 24 ± 4 Myr.
Finally, we have also searched for circumstellar disc hosts utilizing the AllWISE catalogue. Although we find no evidence for warm, dusty discs, we identify several stars with excess emission in the WISE W4 band at 22 μm. Based on the limited number of W4 detections, we
estimate a debris disc fraction of 32{\textasciicircum}\{+12\}\_\{-8\} per cent for the 32 Ori group.},

This increased astrometric precision presents an opportunity to find new binary stars and moving groups. We search for high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS by identifying pairs of stars consistent with having the same 3D velocity using a marginalized likelihood ratio test to discriminate candidate comoving pairs from the field population. Although we perform some visualizations using (bias-corrected) inverse parallax as a point estimate of distance, the likelihood ratio is computed with a probabilistic model that includes the covariances of parallax and proper motions and marginalizes the (unknown) true distances and 3D velocities of the stars. We find 13,085 comoving star pairs among 10,606 unique stars with separations as large as 10 pc (our search limit). Some of these pairs form larger groups through mutual comoving neighbors: many of these pair networks correspond to known open clusters and OB associations, but we also report the discovery of several new comoving groups.

	abstract = {We report the selection and spectroscopic confirmation of 129 new late-type (SpT = K3-M6) members of the Tucana-Horologium moving group, a nearby (d {\textasciitilde} 40 pc), young (τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr) population of comoving stars. We also report observations for 13 of the 17 known Tuc-Hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67\%. We have used radial velocities, Hα emission, and Li6708 absorption to distinguish
between contaminants and bona fide members. Our expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known population by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 in total and by a factor of {\textasciitilde}8 for members with SpT {\textgreater}= K3, but even so, the K-M dwarf population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. Our expanded census allows for a much more detailed study of Tuc-Hor than was previously feasible. The spatial distribution of members appears to trace a two-dimensional sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but a very narrow distribution (±5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity
distribution is very small, with a scatter of ±1.1 km
s-1 about the mean UVW velocity for stars spanning the entire 50 pc extent of Tuc-Hor. We also show that the isochronal age (τ {\textasciitilde} 20-30 Myr) and the lithium depletion boundary age (τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr)
disagree, following the trend in other pre-main-sequence populations for isochrones to yield systematically younger ages. The Hα emission line strength follows a trend of increasing equivalent width with later spectral type, as is seen for young clusters. We find that moving group members have been depleted of measurable lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. None of our targets have significant infrared excesses in the WISE W3 band, yielding an upper limit on warm debris disks of F {\textless} 0.7\%. Finally, our purely kinematic and color-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for
activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60\% of K-M dwarfs in Tuc-Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would have been omitted in X-ray-selected samples. In contrast, GALEX UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for youth achieve completeness of 77\% and purity of 78\%, and we suggest new SpT-dependent selection criteria that will yield {\textgreater}95\% completeness for τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr populations with
GALEX data available.},

stellar associations within 150 pc of the Sun. It includes 27 young
associations with ages in the range ˜1-800 Myr, modeled with
multivariate Gaussians in six-dimensional (6D) XYZUVW space. It is the
first such multi-association classification tool to include the nearest
sub-groups of the Sco-Cen OB star-forming region, the IC 2602, IC 2391,
Pleiades and Platais 8 clusters, and the ρ Ophiuchi, Corona
Australis, and Taurus star formation regions. A model of field stars is
built from a mixture of multivariate Gaussians based on the
Besançon Galactic model. The algorithm can derive membership
probabilities for objects with only sky coordinates and proper motion,
but can also include parallax and radial velocity measurements, as well
as spectrophotometric distance constraints from sequences in
color-magnitude or spectral type-magnitude diagrams. BANYAN
Σ benefits from an analytical solution to the Bayesian
marginalization integrals over unknown radial velocities and distances
that makes it more accurate and significantly faster than its
predecessor BANYAN II. A contamination versus hit rate analysis is
presented and demonstrates that BANYAN Σ achieves a better
classification performance than other moving group tools available in
the literature, especially in terms of cross-contamination between young
associations. An updated list of bona fide members in the 27 young
associations, augmented by the Gaia-DR1 release, as well as all
parameters for the 6D multivariate Gaussian models for each association
and the Galactic field neighborhood within 300 pc are presented. This
new tool will make it possible to analyze large data sets such as the
upcoming Gaia-DR2 to identify new young stars. IDL and Python versions
of BANYAN Σ are made available with this publication, and a more

also take the individual proper motion errors into account. For 724
clusters, this is the first determination of proper motion, and for the
whole sample, we present results with a much larger number of identified

mean radial velocity of 364 clusters (102 unpublished so far) with the

Instead, we have chosen several illustrative examples. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We describe some of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity, and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar populations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated. Two different populations in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously identified in the HRD. Membership and mean parameters for a selected list of open clusters are provided. They allow drawing very detailed cluster sequences, highlighting fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will lead to more insight in stellar physics. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential of combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for studies in stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire new area for HRD-based studies.

They are also fundamental to stellar evolution studies. The second {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data release contains precise astrometry at the submilliarcsecond level and homogeneous photometry at the mmag level, that can be used to characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In this study we aim to establish a list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data alone.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We compiled a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature. We then applied an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We obtained a list of members and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 astrometry, the fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to date. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 60 new open clusters in the fields analysed during this study.},

	abstract = {The two reaction wheel K2 mission promises and has delivered new discoveries in the stellar and exoplanet fields. However, due to the loss of accurate pointing, it also brings new challenges for the data reduction processes. In this paper, we describe a new reduction pipeline for extracting high-precision photometry from the K2 data set, and present public light curves for the K2 Campaign 1 target pixel data set. Key to our reduction is the derivation of global astrometric solutions from the target stamps, from which accurate centroids are passed on for high-precision photometry extraction. We extract target light curves for sources from a combined UCAC4 and EPIC catalogue - this includes not only primary targets of the K2 campaign 1, but also any other stars that happen to fall on the pixel stamps. We provide the raw light curves, and the products of various detrending processes aimed at removing different types of systematics. Our astrometric solutions achieve a median residual of ˜0.127 arcsec. For bright stars, our best 6.5 h
precision for raw light curves is ˜20 parts per million (ppm). For our detrended light curves, the best 6.5 h precision achieved is ˜15 ppm. We show that our detrended light curves have fewer
systematic effects (or trends, or red-noise) than light curves produced by other groups from the same observations. Example light curves of transiting planets and a Cepheid variable candidate, are also presented. We make all light curves public, including the raw and detrended photometry, at http://k2.hatsurveys.org.},

	abstract = {Ground-based exoplanet surveys such as SuperWASP, HAT Network of Telescopes (HATNet), and KELT have discovered close to two hundred transiting extrasolar planets in the past several years. The strategy of these surveys is to look at a large field of view and measure the brightnesses of its bright stars to around half a percent per point precision, which is adequate for detecting hot Jupiters. Typically, these surveys use CCD detectors to achieve high precision photometry. These CCDS, however, are expensive relative to other consumer-grade optical imaging devices, such as digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs). We look at the possibility of using a DSLR camera for precision photometry. Specifically, we used a Canon EOS 60D camera that records light in three colors simultaneously. The DSLR was integrated into the HATNet survey and collected observations for a month, after which photometry was extracted for 6600 stars in a selected stellar field. We found that the DSLR achieves a best-case median absolute deviation of 4.6 mmag per 180 s exposure when the DSLR color channels are combined, and 1000 stars are measured to better than 10 mmag (1\%). Also, we achieve 10 mmag or better photometry in the individual colors. This is good enough to detect transiting hot Jupiters. We performed a candidate search on all stars and found four candidates, one of which is KELT-3b, the only known transiting hot Jupiter in our selected field. We conclude that the Canon 60D is a cheap, lightweight device capable of useful photometry in multiple colors.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
	scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
	international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
	subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
	spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.

	abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
	Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
	products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and
	GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our
implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort. The code is available online at http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the GNU General Public License v2.},

These coefficients can be used in many different fields of stellar physics as synthetic light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits, stellar diameters, line profiles in rotating stars, and others. The limb-darkening coefficients were computed specifically for the photometric system of the space mission TESS and were performed by adopting the least-square method. In addition, the linear and bi-parametric coefficients, by adopting the flux conservation method, are also available. On the other hand, to take into account the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we computed the passband gravity-darkening coefficients \$y({\textbackslash}lambda)\$ using a general differential equation in which we consider the effects of convection and of the partial derivative \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln I({\textbackslash}lambda)\}/\{{\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln g\}\}{\textbackslash}right)\_\{T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\}\$. To generate the limb-darkening coefficients we adopt two stellar atmosphere models: ATLAS (plane-parallel) and PHOENIX (spherical, quasi-spherical, and \$r\$-method). The specific intensity distribution was fitted using five approaches: linear, quadratic, square root, logarithmic, and a more general one with four terms. These grids cover together 19 metallicities ranging from 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ up to 10\${\textasciicircum}\{+1\}\$ solar abundances, 0 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ log g \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 6.0 and 1500 K \${\textbackslash}leq\$ T\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 50000 K.

The algorithm searches for signals characterized by a periodic alternation between two discrete levels, with much less time spent at the lower level. We present numerical as well as analytical results to predict the possible detection significance at various signal parameters. It is shown that the crucial parameter is the effective signal-to-noise ratio - the expected depth of the transit divided by the standard deviation of the measured photometric average within the transit. When this parameter exceeds the value of 6 we can expect a significant detection of the transit. We show that the box-fitting algorithm performs better than other methods available in the astronomical literature, especially for low signal-to-noise ratios.},

time, C. Alard and R. H. Lupton in 1998 proposed an “optimal image
subtraction” (OIS) method that constructs a convolution kernel
from a set of matching stars distributed across the two images to be
subtracted. Using multivariable least squares, the kernel is derived and
can be designed to vary by pixel coordinates across the convolved image.
Local effects in the optics, including aberrations or other spatially
sensitive perturbations to a perfect image, can be mitigated. This paper
presents the specific systems of equations that originate from the OIS
method. Also included is a complete description of the Gaussian
components basis vectors used by Alard \& Lupton to construct the
convolution kernel. An alternative set of basis vectors, called the
delta function basis, is also described. Important issues are addressed,
including the selection of the matching stars, differential background
correction, constant photometric flux, contaminated pixel masking, and
alignment at the subpixel level. Computer algorithms for the OIS method
were developed, written using the Interactive Data Language (IDL), and
applications demonstrating these algorithms are presented.},

While light curves will be provided for ∼400,000 targets observed at 2 minute cadence, observations of most stars will only be provided as full-frame images (FFIs) at 30 minute cadence. The TESS image scale of ∼21″/pix is highly susceptible to crowding, blending, and source confusion, and the highly spatially variable point-spread function (PSF) will challenge traditional techniques, such as aperture and Gaussian-kernel PSF photometry. We use official “End-to-End 6” TESS simulated FFIs to demonstrate a difference image analysis pipeline, using a δ -function kernel, that achieves the mission specification noise floor of 60 ppm hr −1/2 . We show that the pipeline performance does not depend on position across the field, and only ∼2\% of stars appear to exhibit residual systematics at the level of ∼5 ppt. We also demonstrate recoverability of planet transits, eclipsing binaries, and other variables. We provide the pipeline as an open-source tool at https://github.com/ryanoelkers/DIA [http://https://github.com/ryanoelkers/DIA] in both IDL and PYTHON. We intend to extract light curves for all point sources in the TESS FFIs as soon as they become publicly available, and will provide the light curves through the Filtergraph data visualization service.

	abstract = {We observed the open clusters M35 and NGC 2158 during the initial K2 
campaign (C0). Reducing these data to high-precision photometric
timeseries is challenging due to the wide point-spread function (PSF)
and the blending of stellar light in such dense regions. We developed an
image-subtraction-based K2 reduction pipeline that is applicable to both
crowded and sparse stellar fields. We applied our pipeline to the
data-rich C0 K2 super stamp, containing the two open clusters, as well
as to the neighboring postage stamps. In this paper, we present our
image subtraction reduction pipeline and demonstrate that this technique
achieves ultra-high photometric precision for sources in the C0 super
stamp. We extract the raw light curves of 3960 stars taken from the
UCAC4 and EPIC catalogs and de-trend them for systematic effects. We
compare our photometric results with the prior reductions published in
the literature. For de-trended TFA-corrected sources in the
12-12.25 \{\{\{K\}\}\}\{\{p\}\} magnitude range, we achieve a
best 6.5-hour window running rms of 35 ppm, falling to 100 ppm for
fainter stars in the 14-14.25 \{\{\{K\}\}\}\{\{p\}\} magnitude
range. For stars with \{K\}p{\textgreater} 14, our de-trended and
6.5-hour binned light curves achieve the highest photometric precision.
Moreover, all our TFA-corrected sources have higher precision on all
timescales investigated. This work represents the first published image
subtraction analysis of a K2 super stamp. This method will be
particularly useful for analyzing the Galactic bulge observations
carried out during K2 campaign 9. The raw light curves and the final
results of our de-trending processes are publicly available at http://k2.hatsurveys.org/archive/.},

Since the FITS format definition document (the “standard”) was last printed in this journal in 2001, several new features have been developed and standardized, notably support for 64-bit integers in images and tables, variable-length arrays in tables, and new world coordinate system conventions which provide a mapping from an element in a data array to a physical coordinate on the sky or within a spectrum. The FITS Working Group of the International Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided here in its entirety. In addition to describing the new features in FITS, numerous editorial changes were made to the previous version to clarify and reorganize many of the sections. Also included are some appendices which are not formally part of the standard. The FITS standard is likely to undergo further evolution, in which case the latest version may be found on the FITS Support Office Web site at \&lt;ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/"\&gt;http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/\&lt;/ext-link\&gt;, which also provides many links to FITS-related resources.},

	abstract = {We have built a reliable and robust system that takes as input an astronomical image, and returns as output the pointing, scale, and orientation of that image (the astrometric calibration or World Coordinate System information). The system requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem in which nothing—not even the image scale—is known. After robust source detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a null hypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B catalog and designed for uniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is \&gt;99.9\% for contemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false positives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B catalog; augmentation with indices built from the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog brings the completeness to 100\% with no false positives. We are using this system to generate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized imaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific investigators, and hobbyists. This is the first step in a program of making it possible to trust calibration meta-data for astronomical data of arbitrary provenance.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}C{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≈4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

We also show that the TFA can be used for the reconstruction of periodic signals by iteratively filtering out systematic distortions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3486},
	abstract = {Among the group of extrasolar planets, transiting planets provide a great opportunity to obtain direct measurements for the basic physical properties, such as mass and radius of these objects. These planets are therefore highly important in the understanding of the evolution and formation of planetary systems: from the observations of photometric transits, the interior structure of the planet and atmospheric properties can also be constrained. The most efficient way to search for transiting extrasolar planets is based on wide-field surveys by hunting for short and shallow periodic dips in light curves covering quite long time intervals. These surveys monitor fields with several degrees in diameter and tens or hundreds of thousands of objects simultaneously. In the practice of astronomical observations, surveys of large field-of-view are rather new and therefore require special methods for photometric data reduction that have not been used before. In this PhD thesis, I summarize my efforts related to the development of a complete software solution for high precision photometric reduction of astronomical images. I also demonstrate the role of this newly developed package and the related algorithms in the case of particular discoveries of the HATNet project. [abridged]},
