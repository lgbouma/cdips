Option 1:
lfit interface with the lfit_PARSEC_BC HATpipe SVN tools. the idea here is tat
you can write some function that takes in the observed magnitdues in many bands
to do the required Teff / A_v fit.

The statement of priors here (e.g., on the metallicity, or the logg) can be
done thru lfit. If you want uncertainties, there's an MCMC option. If not,
you can do a downhill simplex for maximum finding.

Option 2:
Get Morton's isocrones package to do it. Seems like a possible plausible use
case!

Option 3:
Kento wrote a code to do this.
It's basically the Morton isochrones code, + the Green (or Bovy) dust map codes
to get the A_V prior. For cases when you want a good radius, this is likely the
best thing. (Perhaps condition on prior knowledge of cluster A_V, or cluster
age, or cluster distance).
