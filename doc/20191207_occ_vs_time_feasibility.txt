When are large samples important?

When objects distributed in a multi-dimensional distribution have properties or
outcomes that vary a lot with position in parameter space.

example:

How many binary stars needed?

f_2(M1, q=M2/M1, a, e) dM1 dq da de

M1 : (0.1Msun - 100Msun) in factors of 1.5 : 17
M2 : (0.01Msun - M1) in factors of 1.5 : 8.5
a : (R1 - 10^3Rsun) in factors of 1.5 : 20
e : (0.01 - 1) in factors of 1.5 : 11
17 x  8.5 x  20 x 11 = 32,000 bins!

if want 20% statistics, need 30 per bin, so minimum 10^6 binaries with
well-determined orbits!

example that I care about:

How many stars with known ages need to be searched for transits before we can
study occurrence vs age?

First think just about detections:

f(Rp, P, age, [Fe/H])

logRp: 2-20Re, factors of 1.78 : 4 bins         --- np.logspace( np.log10(2), np.log10(20), 5)
logP: 0.2-20days, factors of 1.78 : 8 bins      --- np.logspace( np.log10(0.2), np.log10(20), 9)
age: 30-3000Myr, factor of 3.56 : 4 bins        --- np.logspace( np.log10(30), np.log10(3000), 5)
[Fe/H]: -0.5 to 0.5, say 3 bins

At least 384 bins, (128 if you ignore [Fe/H]).

To get 20% statistics, need ~23 detections per bin. (23^{-1/2} ~= 0.2).

Well, to get N hot jupiters, you need to search
  
  N * p_geom^{-1} * p_occurrence^{-1} stars.

Note p_geom = (a/Rstar)^{-1} = 0.1 * [(a/Rstar)/10]^{-1}.
For HJs, p_occurrence ~= 0.005 * [p_occurrence/0.005].

So in astro notation, to get N hot jupiters, you need to search

  2* 10^3 * N * [(a/Rstar)/10]^{+1} * [p_occurrence/0.005]^{-1}

stars. So for 20% statistics (N=23 detections), you need to search

  23 * 2 * 10^3 * (N/23) * [(a/Rstar)/10]^{+1} * [p_occurrence/0.01]^{-1} stars

  ~= 5 * 10^3 * (N/23) * [(a/Rstar)/10]^{+1} * [p_occurrence/0.01]^{-1}

stars with known ages.

For 10% statistics, N=100 detections. You need to search

  ~= 2 * 10^4 * (N/100) * [(a/Rstar)/10]^{+1} * [p_occurrence/0.01]^{-1}

stars with known ages.

----------
Do enough stars with known ages exist?

The tricky point is that the age distribution of stars with ages between
30-3000 Myr is nonuniform. Younger stars are relatively rarer, and located in
very specific regions of the sky (often regions that make searching for
transits more difficult).

My compilation (Bouma+2019, CDIPS-I) had Nstar = 1,061,447 stars with known
ages at G_Rp<16, with an age distribution that was basically log-normal, with
mean ~2e8 years, width maybe 1 dex (what you expect, roughly, for an OC
population).

Somewhere between 10% to 25% of these stars are actually the ages that are
quoted. Call this number f_ageFP.

Since then, the target star catalog has grown to maybe 1.3e6 stars with
reported ages.

So something like 

Nstar * f_ageFP ~= 1.3e5 * (Nstar/1.3e6) * (f_ageFp/0.1)

age-dated stars EXIST to begin with.

----------
There are a few additional barriers to the transit search.

1. Some target stars are too big to be searched.
2. Some target stars are too faint to be searched.
3. Some target stars are in regions too crowded to be searched.

The "searchability" of course depends on the planet size of interest.

The crowding problem can cause major source confusion. Difference imaging with
forced aperture photometry can solve the dilution problem, but in vetting it
still risks missing signals, or not following up signals that are detected.

----------
So the question of "Do enough stars with known ages exist?" is not
well-specified.

The planet size and orbital period of interest needs to be assessed. (And so do
the stellar properties, including the crowding).

Break each of problems 1-3 down into their own fractions. Guesstimate as follows.

1. f_1 ~= 0.66 (i.e., 0.66 survive. See Bouma+2019 Fig 12, shows there aren't TOO MANY giants)

2. f_2 ~= 0.66 (say you're looking for HJs, so most are SNR-ok)

3. f_3 ~= 0.5 (by the TESS GI proposal crowding estimate)

Then how many searchable stars exist? Roughly,

  N_searchable = f_1 * f_2 * f_3 * Nstar * f_ageFP
  N_searchable ~= 2.8e4 * (Nstar/1.3e6) * (f_ageFp/0.1) * f_1/0.66 * f_2/0.66 * f_3/0.5

Compare to

  N_needed_for_10%_statistics ~= 2 * 10^4 * (N/100) * [(a/Rstar)/10]^{+1} * [p_occurrence/0.01]^{-1}.

Of course, any of my numbers, particularly those regarding the effectiveness of
the search, might be wrong.  But the general point concerning the feasibility
of occurrence vs age for HJs is clear.

Note from the TESS GI proposal, we thought something like 40 HJs would be
discoverable, and 10 Hot Neptunes.

For smaller planets, it helps that they're more common. But their smaller
signals may also be more difficult for TESS. The suspicion from the HN numbers
above is that there will be fewer, but you never know!
