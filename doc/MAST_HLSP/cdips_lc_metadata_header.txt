Title: cdips_lc_metadata_20200812_S1_thru_S13.csv

Date: 12 Aug 2020

Author: L. Bouma et al.

Contents: This ';'-separated CSV file is a list of CDIPS light curves produced
from the TESS FFIs from Sectors 1 through 13.  See Bouma et al., 2019 for a
description of how these light curves were made.

Purpose: This file can be used to select light curves for a specific cluster,
as reported by specific authors in the literature. For example, to select all
the CDIPS light curves for members of NGC 2516 reported by Cantat-Gaudin et
al., 2018, one could do the following in python:

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('cdips_lc_metadata_20200812_S1_thru_S13.csv', sep=';')
sel = (
  df.reference.str.contains('CantatGaudin_2018') &
  df.cluster.str.contains('NGC_2516')
)
df_ngc2516 = df[sel]
```

This yields 4992 light curves for 876 unique stars observed over the first year
of TESS, with an average of ~5 sectors per star. Given the list of source_ids,
MAST can then be queried for the light curves (for example, using astroquery).

COLUMN DESCRIPTION

path: String containing sector, camera, ccd, and source_id for star with CDIPS
light curve.

source_id: Star's Gaia DR2 source identifier.

ra: Stellar decimal right ascension, unit degree.

dec: Stellar decimal declination, unit degree.

pmra: Stellar proper motion in RA* direction, units mas/yr, source Gaia DR2.

pmdec: Stellar proper motion in DEC direction, units mas/yr, source Gaia DR2.

parallax: Stellar parallax, units mas, source Gaia DR2.

phot_g_mean_mag: Stellar Gaia G magnitude, source Gaia DR2.

phot_bp_mean_mag: Stellar Gaia Bp magnitude, source Gaia DR2.

phot_rp_mean_mag: Stellar Gaia Rp magnitude, source Gaia DR2.

cluster: ','-separated string of cluster names for which this star has been
reported to be a member

reference: ','-separated string of literature references that reported the
star's clsuter membership.

ext_catalog_name: ','-separated name that was used by the external catalog for
this star.

dist: ','-separated string of crossmatch distances, if applicable. Non-zero for
cases in which the original reference claiming cluster membership was not using
Gaia data.  Units: arcseconds.
