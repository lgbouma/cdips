The initial i/2;d3/2 reduction of 1585, a field at galactic latitude 0 and
longitude ~320 (so, 40 degrees in longitude from the galactic center), looked
rough.

Light-curves of the three available TOIs only showed 1 obvious one, by eye.

The TFA RMS vs mag reached sub-mmag, but not for the 75th percentile.

Inspecting RANDOM light-curves pushed me to think "what if I redid this with
i/0?". (Because random draws of ~15th to 16th mag LCs gave very poor results in
the raw LCs, even if TFA corrected them somewhat).

----------

So I did an i/0 reduction of the same field.

Light-curves of the three available TOIs only showed 1 obvious one.  However
TOI 1093, previously not visible in i/2;d3/2, seemed more noticeable in i/0.

Comparing each TOI LC to the i/2;d3/2 counterpart, the raw light curves seemed
to have more point-to-point scatter for i/0. However they had less long-term
red noise. The TFA LCs looked comparable.

Inspecting the ACF plots of the raw LCs, the i/0 showed weaker correlation at
short time lags (of <~1 day). (By an ACF value of about 0.1-0.2).

For the TFA ACFs, no real difference.

In TFA RMS vs mag:
* ap1, the i/0 vs i/2;d3/2 plots look comparable in 25th and 50th percentiles.
  The 75th percentile for i/0 is maybe a bit better.
* In ap2, i/0 is also marginally better, mostly in the 75th percentile envelope.

The MAJOR DIFFERENCE is in the RMS vs mag plots of the RAW light curves.
In ap1, there's a factor of ~1.5x better for i/0.

----------

What about the images?

The i/0 reduction is clean.
The i/2;d3/2 reduction has many artifacts.

----------

How to choose?

We care about transits. So we don't want correlated signals at transit duration
timescales (hours), or orbital perid timescales (many days). The ACFs showed
the i/0 reduction was better for all of these, even if point-to-point it seemed
a bit worse.

So, i/0.
