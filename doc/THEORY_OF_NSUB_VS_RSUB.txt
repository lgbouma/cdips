Using "nsub" instead of "rsub" introduces a sign error in the magnitudes that
are derived. I know this because all the transits are the wrong way around.
This can be fixed in post-processing.

A more general concern is: is there any theoretical reason to prefer one
direction over the other? My thought is NO.

Let D be the difference image, I the target image, M the model of the static
background, R the reference image (from median stack), and K the kernel. _nsub_
means:

D_xy = I_xy - Mxy,
M_xy = (R \otimes K)_xy, s.t.    chi^2 = \sum (I_xy - M_xy) minimized.

_rsub_ means:
D_xy = R_xy - Mxy,
M_xy = (I \otimes K)_xy, s.t.    chi^2 = \sum (R_xy - M_xy) minimized.

In nsub, you convolve the high SNR median-stacked frame to match a lower SNR
image frame. (Usually, this is a blurring).

In rsub, you convolve the low SNR median-stacked frame to match a high SNR
image frame. (Usually this would be a sharpening).

In THEORY, it seems that either direction should be fine; it shouldn't matter.
The convolution should be able to sharpen just as well as it can blur.

I hesitate though, because the literature on the topic (e.g., Miller+08,
Bramich+08) discusses the problem from the 

perspective of ground-based observers, where the seeing problem matters MORE.

In this case... yes, it does seem like BLURRING is an easier operation than
sharpening.

It seems like it's asking the convolution kernel to do LESS.  It's easier to
lose information than to gain it!

HOWEVER arguing the point from the PoV of poisson statistics... it shouldn't
matter! Both operations have 1 high SNR image, 1 low SNR image. No matter which
you're convolving around, the statistical fluctuations shouldn't make a
difference.

--------

EXPERIMENTALLY, I checked in 1190 vs 1192, where 1190 was nsub, 1192 was rsub.
(I didn't fix the TFA detrending stars, which is annoying). In the TFA
lightcurves, the RMS vs mag for each was IDENTICAL.

So this would argue that it's not important, though theory would suggestion
that "nsub" is the better approach.
