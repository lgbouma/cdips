For sectors 6-11, in the "post-processing" steps of actually finding the
planets, we used a penalized B-spline. We set the maximum number of knots to
50, which for each TESS sector (25 days) corresponds to a 0.5 day window.

Visual inspection of the results indicate that the "breaks" introduced seem to
be discontinuous. This is obviously not ideal. It might even be a bug??

----------

There's a broader discussion about "ideal window size" selection
(https://wotan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Interface.html#choosing-the-right-window-size).
Hippke suggests 2-3x longer than the transit duration is ideal for
time-windowed sliders.

We're doing a 0.5 day slider, so transits longer than 0.5/3*24 ~= 4 hours will
be harmed.  This seems about what we want.

----------

Ok. Taking a step back, my main preference, I think, would be for wotan to not
yield a discontinuous detrending model.

----------

It also seems clear that TFA can sometimes *inject* noise, making transits
*harder* to recover.

For both of the examples that I'm working with, that's exactly the case. The
idea of TFA being the "right initial detrending step" might be a bit wrong.
Starting from the high SNR dip+rotn signal seems better.

The wonky chopping functions have been solved. To solve them, yjust median
subtract the time center.
