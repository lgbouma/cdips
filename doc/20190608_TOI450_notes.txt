The CDIPS search turned up Gaia DR2 4827527233363019776 = TIC 77951245 = TOI
450.

Current SG2 status is listed as:

"unknown stellar (and candidate) radius. Possible small centroid shift to NW.
EXOFASTv2 results suspicous. Potential blend in SED photometry (optical doesn't
match well), Trimodal stellar mass, prefers metalicity off the MIST grid
([Fe/H] > +0.5). mstar=1.2, rstar=2, rp=1.1 Rj.
SG1 finds event on target, consistent between Ic, rp, and TESS."

I write to note that Gagne+2018 (BANYAN XIII) identified this star as a
high-likelihood candidate member of the Columba association, which is ~40 Myr
old.

The Gagne work selected stars within 100pc, and ran the parallaxes and proper
motions through BANYAN sigma to derive membership probabilities within 27 known
young nearby associations.  The algorithm can also take radial velocities, but
for this star none was available. 

This procedure gave 3510 entries with bayesian membership probablity above 90%,
that were separated by less than 5 km/s from their best-matching associations
in UVW space.  (727 of these entries had DR2 RVs).
The 90% threshold was apparently chosen "to identify only the most unambiguous
members of young associations... while minimizing the rate of contamination
from random field interlopers."

1399 entries from the 3510 entry list were then dropped because they were
already known.
12 more K dwarfs were dropped because they were the subject of another paper in
prep.

Because parallax solutions in the galactic plane suffer from cross-matching
confusion, the properties (i.e. colors and existence) of the stars were then
verified by making finder charts from SDSS, 2MASS, WISE, Pan-STARRS, VHS, and
UKIDSS images.
This manual inspection led to 504 unphysical entries being dropped.

Finally, 327 additional candidates were rejected based on inspected the Gaia
absolute G-band magnitude vs G-GRp color. If the candidates were near the
main sequence in color-magnitude space, they were rejeted.

Most of these rejected candidates were in "the ABDMG (114), betaPMG (79) and
COL (37). This is consistent with the deter- mination of Gagne et al. (2018)
that these associations are the most subject to contamination by unrelated
field interlopers in kinematic-based searches, mostly because of their
proximity (i.e., their members cover a larger fraction of the sky)."

Other assessment of the youth (performed by Gagne, still) include the xray
luminosity and the NUV-G color versus the Gaia G-GRp color (Gagne+2018's
Figures 10 and 11).

For this target star, I went to Vizier and got the full gaia dr2 page:

http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-5?-ref=VIZ5cfbc9465837&-out.add=.&-source=I/345/gaia2&-c=079.00508771755%20-31.41269396838,eq=ICRS,rs=2&-out.orig=o

I then took the J2000 RA and dec, and searched over the ~20k tables present in
vizier.

The GALEX-DR5 result is 

NUV = 22.265

(though it has a quality flag set for being a bright star near the field edge).

Gaia G mag = 13.8042,
G_Rp = 12.5260

NUV - G = 8.5,
G - G_Rp = 1.28.

The above NUV-G, compared to Figure 11, is somewhat blue, but not WHOPPINGLY
blue. This kind of is consistent with the small, 1% amplitude variability and
only 1 or 2 flares in the TESS data.

Ah also I checked ESO archive and there were no RVs.  GJ 3341b is like ~5
arcminutes away though.
