get files needed before subtraction:

  should matter:

    * catalog_faintrmag: cutoff in magnitude used when making the list
      of frame-project sources to extract photometry from.

  hope don't matter:

    * aperture list. size of aperture, size of annulus used to measure
      bkgnd. shouldn't matter here b/c I don't think we're using the
      aperture photometry values....

    * fiphotfluxthreshold: ditto. (though it will matter for
      aperture photometry vs image subtraction photometry comparison).

    * anetfluxthreshold: initial flux threshold used to get WCS solution

    * anetradius: 'Radius (in deg) over which to search for index files
      in ' 'astrometry.net or net. For TESS, you want to go big -- e.g.,
      30.'

    * anettweak: default=6, SIP (Simple Imaging Polynomial) order.
      Higher = more flexibility for frame distortion. Max of 10.
   
image subtraction:

  should matter:

    * photreffluxthreshold

    * kernelspec (4 parameters): default='b/4;i/4;d=4/4'

      * i/<spatial order> identity kernel (a.k.a. flux term) with the
        specified order of polynomial spatial variations.

      * b/<spatial order> constant offset kernel (a.k.a. background
        term) with the specified order of polynomial spatial variations

       * d=<size>/<spatial order> discrete kernel with the half-size of
         <size> and the specified order of polynomial spatial variations

    * aperturelist
       default:  "1.95:7.0:6.0,2.45:7.0:6.0,2.95:7.0:6.0"

  hope don't matter:

    * photdisjointradius
          default=2,
          https://fitsh.net/wiki/man/fiphot gives details.
          During the bacground determination on the aperture annuli,
          omit the pixels which are closer to the other centroids than 
          the specified radius (in pixel units).

    * should we be doing individual subframes at a time? rather than
      whole frames at a time? possibly.

      are we going to need to create separate master frames for every
      ~2.5 days, because of the momentum dumps? possible. the image
      translation should avoid this though.

detrending:

  should matter:

    * epdsmooth=11,
          help=(
              'number of cadences used when passing a median filter over the'
              'magnitude time series before EPD (see '
              'imagesubphot.epd_magseries_imagesub). For HATPI default is 21, or'
              ' a ~10 minute median filter. For TESS FFIs, try 11 = 5.5hrs.'
          )

    * epdsigclip=10
          'sigma clipping aplpied to epd lightcurves. assumed symmetric.'

  hope don't matter:

    choices of TFA template stars:
       min_nstars=50, max_nstars=1000,
       brightest_mag=8.5, faintest_mag=13.0,
