Updates in the v0.3 -> v0.4 CDIPS target star catalog.
==========================================

MERGED NEW CATALOGS
-----

Added Kounkel & Covey 2019 (KC19) catalog members (their tables 1 & 2).
----------
"cluster" was whatever Kounkel & Covey gave as their crossmatched names, else
groupids (if their crossmatched name was NaN).

Added Kounkel et al (2018) orion catalog (their Table 2).
----------
Originally, 16754 stars in the direction of Orion.  Required that the star
actually be _listed_ in one of the groups (i.e., the group column had to not be
null, or labelled "field").  This yielded 5208 stars in some group of the Orion
complex.

Added Villa-Velez_Brown_2018_PMS_ScoCen list.
----------
They didn't put out a table. To get these objects, you do the following.

Clone https://github.com/Jurgenvilla/Gaia_DR2_ScoCen/tree/v1.0.0
Run the entire Gaia_AstroQuery.ipynb notebook
Run the Data_Selection.ipynb notebook. Hack it to give source-ids in the
output.
Manually copy the output file of csvs to to the moving group subdir:
`scp DR2_PreMainSequence_SOURCE_IDS.csv lbouma@phtess2:~/proj/cdips/data/cluster_data/moving_groups/VillaVelez_2018_DR2_PreMainSequence_MATCH.csv`

Notice that the reason why Coordinates_DR2_PreMainSequence.csv contains 2x the
number of members as reported in the paper is that there's a random line of
code at the end of this jupyter notebook that duplicates the lists. No reason,
just does it.

Added Cantat-Gaudin et al (2019) vela OB2 catalog (vizier result)
----------
Opted to not assign individual names to the 7 populations therein (even though
there is some overlap with Kharchenko's names). The reason being: Tristan
argues that it doesn't really make sense to use old names that were assigned to
old blobs when the new data shows that the old blobs were insufficiently
precise.


Considered including Sim+2019.
----------
They did not publish membership lists, so skipped.


OTHER CHANGES
-----

* "k13_logt" is now "logt"
* added logt_provenance. It is either Kharchenko 2013, or Kounkel & Covey 2019
  (for their members, specifically).
* added unique name processing for CG19 (Vela OB2), Kounkel18 (Orion), and
  VillaVelez (ScoOB2)


UPDATED STATS
-----

Erm. I think I made an error for the Kounkel & Covey name matching. The things
they listed as having known names should have known ages. I don't think this
update includes that.
