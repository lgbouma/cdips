=========================================
POSSIBLE FIGURES

----------
* a "conceptual overview" of the pipeline, similar to Fig 28 of Pal
  (2009) thesis.

----------
* histogram of "astrometric solution residual", where the x axis is the
distance between project catalog coordinates and the detected source
coordinates on the CCDs. (e.g., Huang+2016 paper)

* you'll want to show these residuals for the released astrometric WCS file, as
  well as the WCS you get from astrometry.net

----------
* movie showing normal images (left), and difference images right
  (w/ sick color divergent scheme), 

----------
* lightcurves showing successive stages of detrending.
  * as in Luger+2016 Fig 1, write the 1-hr scatter in a text-box 

  * for each subplot, need to show: DATA. MODEL. RESIDUAL.
  (in other words: EPD is just a model for the systematics.
  ditto TFA. you need to recast your thinking in these terms).

----------
* noise in 1 hr, vs. TESS magnitude. do it with a scatter plot.

----------
* maybe some transit injection results?

----------
* a collection of ~9 lightcurves of interesting objects. (or more).
highlight the ability to give STELLAR VARIABILITY. as well as other kinds...


==========================================
FIGURES IN ORDER (IF APJL, WHICH MIGHT BE GOOD)

1. Clusters.
   (a) all-sky map of clusters observed by TESS. (E.g., from
       Kharchenko, within 2kpc, TESS footprint overplotted).
   (b) smaller rectangular map of clusters observed in sector 6.
       (labelled. perhaps w/ data from the LC dataset. Else from tessmaps).

2. Stars in clusters. 
  (a) HR diagram of "good" (close) subset
  (b) CDF of stellar brightness (G_Rp cut) for whole sample.
  (c) Distribution of contamination ratio from TICv8
      * above distribution linked w/ image of e.g., M42 on crowded
        end, and some dispersed cluster on other end.

3. Method to produce light curves of stars in clusters.
  "Conceptual overview" of pipeline, similar to Fig 28 of Pal (2009).
  (Maybe).

4. RMS (30 minutes) vs catalog T mag, for Sector 6. Show residual as
   subpanel.
   Maybe also include averaged ACFs as a sub-panel.
  
5. 3x3 collection of LCs of favorite objects. 3 PCs. 3 EBs. 3 stellar
   rotn.


==========================================
NB. APJL requires 5 COMBINED tables + figures.
A supplement would also be possible, if your work contained "extensive
amounts of data or calculations with relatively little analysis or
interpretations".
