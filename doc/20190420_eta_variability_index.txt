What is the "eta" variability index, from Kim+ 2014?

FeatureL eta
ratio of the mean of square of successive differences
to the variance of the data points.

eta = < square of successive differences > / variance of data

as described in appendix A,

eta measures the degree of trends (e.g., monotonic increase of decrease
of flux in a long-term baseline).

cites: von Neumann 1941.

eta is defined as

eta = 1/(N-1) * 1/sigma^2 * sum_over_mags_indexed_by_i (m_{i+1} - m_i)^2.

From Kim+2014 Figure A.1, it seems like eta can only really strongly
separate out long period variables (LPVs) and "BVs" (some other variable).

Running Lomb-Scargle on the small set of candidate TFA template stars
might be worth while, if it gave you a good S/N estimate.
(E.g., if S/N of a period is greater than say 20 or whatever, toss).

....

or you can use the FAP estimate from astropy's Lomb Scargle routine.
