blanco 1, in cam1 ccd2, has most stars.

(or EB?)

a few of the stars show large flare-looking things in second orbit that could be from stray light subtraction

...

2320868389659322368 has primary eclipse depth 0.2 mags, secondary 0.06 mags. period 1.1 days.
unless planet were EXCEPTIONALLY inflated, mostly likely an EB.
nonetheless, the nicest i've seen so far in blanco-1, and almost certainly a member!
