Scope:

* for a given star (usually a young star), you want to know what you could have
  found.  (for planet detection, yes... also for other types of variability)

* you have light curves (+ background time-series, and other PCA trend vectors
  if you want those), mostly of young stars.

* you want to know: what is your detection pipeline sensitive to?

----------

Approach:

* Start with the star identifier (i.e., a Gaia one)

* Find all light curves that you have made

* Do some kind of "long-term trend" correction, over each ORBIT, since that is
  the relevant physical timescale. (To correct for background trends, mostly)

  * Work with IRM{N}, where {N} is appropriate based on stellar brightness
    (and/or crowding).

* Stitch all sectors together, to make a multisector light curve.

* You now have a light curve that, if it's a young star, is probably dominated
  by stellar variability.

  * For planet searching:

    * "local correction of rotation"? see researchTODO
    * Battley+20 peak cutting?
    * LOWESS filters? (again per Battley+20)

  * Then, inject + recover to see what works best

  * For other variability:

    * Standard periodogram search.
