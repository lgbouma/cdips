The earlier note on this topic,
20201109_injectionrecovery_completeness_goldenvariability.txt, wound up being
useful in the ocntext of the NGC 2516 study, and in figuring out how to do a
"light" PCA detrending to remove only the SYSTEMATIC components of the
variability.

This is great for the tasks of rotation period measurement (the point of the
NGC2516 paper), and studying complex rotators, among others.

However for transit-hunting, it doesn't cut it.

In the upcoming Cycle 2 reductions that Hartman has been working on, this was
addressed per https://github.com/lgbouma/cdips/issues/3.

So, the tests should be done on a "gold sample" of PCA1 (or maybe PCA2) light
curves from sectors 14 through 19.  [Rather than S1-S13, which I guess should
be rerun].

(Just b/c those are the sectors that have been reduced from Cycle 2, so far).

What are the best clusters in those fields?

KC19: after looking at mw2d, I'm guessing:

Chameleon_I
CrA
Upper_Sco
Stephenson_1
Alpha_per (Theia 133)
RSG_5
Theia 506 (very close!)
Theia 507
AB_Dor
Pleiades
UBC_1 (i.e., Theia 520)

So the approach is: for each of these clusters, collect any and all S14-S19 light
curves that exist based on the KC19 list.
