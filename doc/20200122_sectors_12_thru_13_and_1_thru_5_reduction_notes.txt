Sector 12 produced 106k CDIPS light-curves.  Sector 13 produced 22k CDIPS
light-curves.  The difference is because TESS began to look away from the
galactic plane.  The Sector 13 CDIPS light-curves are also particularly
affected by scattered light from the Earth, since the galactic plane is mostly
in Camera 1, which also points closest to the ecliptic.

1598 initially failed due to an NFS memory overload (it's a galactic center
field). This was avoided by killing processes on all non-phtess1 systems and
rerunning.

1604 had spikes that IMO are nasty. They come from one of the template vectors.
(which SOMEHOW isn't being flagged as varible, when it clearly is...). Reran
with "i/0" instead of "i/2;d=3/2".

1609 literally had a pulsation signal injected. not acceptable. Reran with
"i/0" instead of "i/2;d=3/2".

1612 initially had bad spikes.

1615 initially injected a contact EB.

1617 initially injected bad short-period variability.

1625 initially had injected the same pulsation mode across LCs.

-> All 4 of these CCDs were rerun sans convolution, in "i/0" mode.
