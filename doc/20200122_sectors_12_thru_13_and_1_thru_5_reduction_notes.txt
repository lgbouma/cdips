1598 initially failed due to an NFS memory overload (it's a galactic center
field). This was avoided by killing processes on all non-phtess1 systems and
rerunning.

1604 had spikes that IMO are nasty. they come from one of the template vectors.
(which SOMEHOW isn't being flagged as varible, when it clearly is...). Reran
with "i/0" instead of "i/2;d=3/2".

1609 literally had a pulsation signal injected. not acceptable. Reran with
"i/0" instead of "i/2;d=3/2".

  * 1612 no, it has bad spikes.
  * 1615 no. a contact EB was injected.
  * 1617 no. bad short-period variability.
  * 1625 (cam4, ccd2). no, they all have the same pulsation mode injection.

  * 1612, 1615, 1625 all need to be rerun with "i/0" kernel.
