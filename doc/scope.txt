- the dominant scope is: lightcurves for stars with known ages.

- implication: we need an approach to present the data. there will be
  single-sector clusters, and multi-sector clusters.
  Particularly for the single-sector clusters, it makes sense to immediately
  reduce them.

  How will we structure the data product?

  "TESS lightcurves for stars with good ages (down to T=16)"

- most of these stars are in crowded fields

- but a non-negligble fraction are not -- e.g., stars in associations or
  moving groups.

- we therefore need to produce lightcurves both in extremely crowded regions
  (open clusters) and in typical field regions.

- and critically, in regions of the sky that might otherwise go neglected
  (towards the galactic plane).

- produce lightcurves on a rolling basis. need stitching procedures...

- we also need to programmatically assign "known ages" to a subset of stars,
  while being clear about the method used to generate them, and the
  provenance of the results.

- it makes sense to do this in the metadata associated with any given
  lightcurve, and/or in a separate catalog of preferred age values for any
  given star.

(provided that this particular catalog also is easily linked to the
lightcurves).
