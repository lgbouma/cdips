Hi Joel,

Our chat earlier this week prompted me to think about whether there were any
fun CDIPS things that we can now do with S1-S13 reduced.

One thing that came to mind was just focusing on a few good clusters. Whatever
the goal -- finding planets, stellar rotation, strange dips, etc -- with S1-S13
done we now have the opportunity to look at some clusters at the full level of
homogeneity we'll get over Year 1.

So, I put together a list of rich, nearby, and usually <~100 Myr southern
clusters. I then made some quicklook plots for CDIPS light curves from these
clusters. I concentrated on light curves for which the membership claim came
from Gaia data. This means slightly different things for each cluster, but this
generally implies higher purity than e.g., the Kharchenko or Dias catalogs.

The light curves usually show strong rotation signatures, flares, etc. They're
also majority M dwarfs, because they're close enough to cover most of the IMF.

I think it might be worth hacking together a generic rotation period-finding
routine for these. One reason has to do with the "corona" stars that we talked
about. To make nice Prot-Teff diagrams with different sets of members, we need
the periods.

It might also be worth using these light curves to create a "test suite" for
planet injection-recovery with whatever detrending we use. Many of these stars
are kind of the "golden sample", in the sense of "you need to be able to find
planets around these!".

Let me know what you think -- sending this also because I also thought you
might just enjoy a glance through the light curves,

Luke

What are their metallicities?

CrA/ 2189  //  ???
Hyades/ 207 // +0.14 dex (Perryman 98)
IC_2602/ 2382 // -0.02 -- +0.04 dex (Nepotil+, Baratella+, cf 837 paper)
kc19group_113/ 1355 // ???
NGC_2516/ 11999 // -0.08 +/- 0.02, from Randich+18, who cited Jacobson+16 and Spina+17
Orion/ 5578 //  -.01 +/- 0.04 (D'Orazi 09)
ScoOB2/ 2102 // "solar" (Mamajek et al 2013)
VelaOB2/ 12896 // Jeffries+09 allow anywhere from half-solar to twice-solar...


Kind of begs the question... have there been any all-sky southern surveys that
can answer the issue of wtf the metallicities of these groups are?
