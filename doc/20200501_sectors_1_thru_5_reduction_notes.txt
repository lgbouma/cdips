Sector 5

  1720 (cam2 ccd3) initially had EB variability injected. Went with "i/0".

  * i/0 did not fix. Interesting. So all the raw lightcurves from this camera
    still have it.
  * So I don't understand what is causing that, which makes this CCD a good
    test-case for understanding WTF causes this janky variability to be injected.

  1721 (cam2 ccd4) initially had EB variability injected. Went with "i/0".

  * i/0 fixed this one.

Sector 4
--------

A zero-point offset is present in all the raw LCs at around BJD 2458413.  This
is corrected reasonably well by the cotrending. However many of the raw LCs
suffer from an offset at this time.

  1709 (cam3 ccd4) had an injected pulsation signal. Reran as i/0.
  This (surprisingly) did not fix the injected signal. The signal is well removed
  by cotrending, but its initial origin will be the subject of future debugging.

  1713 (cam4 ccd4) had an injected eclipsing binary. Reran as i/0. This fixed the
  injected EB.


--------
Sector 3
--------

In an initial run, we empirically found that BJDs 2458394 through 2458396
(roughly) showed a ~2-2.5 day slow rise and decrease across all cameras and
ccds. These time windows were masked.

Compared to later sectors (e.g., S6-S13), the effects of periodic momentum
wheel dumps on the raw light curves is more noticeable. It is corrected
reasonably well by cotrending.

  projid 1684 (cam1 ccd3) had an injected eclipsing binary. Reran it with i/0.
  Worked.

  1687 (cam2 ccd2) had an injected RR Lyrae signal across raw LCs. Reran as i/0.
  Worked.

  1693 (cam3 ccd4) had an injected pulsation signal. Reran as i/0.  Seems to have
  worked in removing it.

  1694 (cam4 ccd1) showed "fluttering" happening in a reasonably large fraction
  (~30%?) of the raw LCs. TFA does ~OK~ correcting.  Reran as i/0 regardless. It
  fixed the problem.


--------
Sector 2
--------

projid 1671 (cam2 ccd2) -- there are zeropoint issues in second orbit.  Reran
with i/0; seemed to mostly fix.  Periodic momentum wheel dumps (and trends
between them) were visible in a small subset of raw LCs.

projid 1672 (cam2 ccd3) -- there is an eb injected. Reran with i/0; did not
fix.  Cotrending does a fine job, though.

projid 1676 (cam3 ccd 3). the LC positions are off. the corner has no LCs.(!!)
wtf? a lot also seem to have a rotator injected.  Reran with i/0. Still a bit
noisy, perhaps with pulsator still present.  Periodic momentum wheel dumps (and
trends between them) are visible in a small subset of raw LCs. Not great!

projid 1677 (cam3 ccd4). two spikes in each orbit. could be removed w i/0.
Reran with i/0; did not fix the spikes.  Periodic momentum wheel dumps (and
trends between them) are visible in many of the raw LCs.

projid 1678 (cam4 ccd1). fluttering, periodically. seems like it could be
correlated with pointing jitter. (because period of flutter is 2.5 days)
Reran with i/0, and TFA template selection failed, because only 5 stars met
the RMS condition, and ZERO stars met the "good stats" condition.
Went back to i/3;d3/2. It showed trends over each momentum dump. TFA corrected
it reasonably well, but the raw lightcurves are affected.

projid 1680 (cam 4 ccd3). looks like a contact binary was injected across
~30% of raw LCs.
Reran with i/0 -- periodic momentum wheel dumps (and trends between them) are
in most of the raw LCs. TFA does ok at "fixing".
There's still some noise, but I think that's a smaller problem than the
momentum dumps and their trends.

projid 1681 (cam4 ccd 4). some kind of EB injected across raw lcs.
Reran with i/0 -- periodic momentum wheel dumps (and trends between them) are
in most of the raw LCs. TFA does ok at "fixing".


--------
Sector 1
--------

  projid 1651 (cam1 ccd2). there are zeropoint offset issues at a few points in
  the LCs.  Reran it with i/0. Did not seem to fix. Cotrending fixes it well
  enough.  (But "stitching") might be needed.

  projid 1657 (cam2 ccd 4). 
  Momentum dumps visible in <50% of raw LCs. Reran at i/0 (I did not note
  initial reason). Fixed well by cotrending.

  projid 1664 (cam4 ccd3).
  Initial rerun reason not noted. In i/0 LCs, raw LCs show ~2 day momentum dump
  trends. Cotrending (TFA) fixes reasonably well.
