  1720 (cam2 ccd3) initially had EB variability injected. Went with "i/0".

  * i/0 did not fix. Interesting. So all the raw lightcurves from this camera
    still have it.
  * So I don't understand what is causing that, which makes this CCD a good
    test-case for understanding WTF causes this janky variability to be injected.

  1721 (cam2 ccd4) initially had EB variability injected. Went with "i/0".

  * i/0 fixed this one.

A zero-point offset is present in all the raw LCs at around BJD 2458413.  This
is corrected reasonably well by the cotrending. However many of the raw LCs
suffer from an offset at this time.

  1709 (cam3 ccd4) had an injected pulsation signal. Reran as i/0.
  This (surprisingly) did not fix the injectec signal. The signal is well removed
  by cotrending, but its initial origin will be the subject of future debugging.

  1713 (cam4 ccd4) had an injected eclipsing binary. Reran as i/0. This fixed the
  injected EB.

In an initial run, we empirically found that BJDs 2458394 through 2458396
(roughly) showed a ~2-2.5 day slow rise and decrease across all cameras and
ccds. These time windows were masked.

Compared to later sectors (e.g., S6-S13), the effects of periodic momentum
wheel dumps on the raw light curves is more noticeable. It is corrected
reasonably well by cotrending.

  projid 1684 (cam1 ccd3) had an injected eclipsing binary. Reran it with i/0.
  Worked.

  1687 (cam2 ccd2) had an injected RR Lyrae signal across raw LCs. Reran as i/0.
  Worked.

  1693 (cam3 ccd4) had an injected pulsation signal. Reran as i/0.  Seems to have
  worked in removing it.

  1694 (cam4 ccd1) showed "fluttering" happening in a reasonably large fraction
  (~30%?) of the raw LCs. TFA does ~OK~ correcting.  Reran as i/0 regardless. It
  fixed the problem.
