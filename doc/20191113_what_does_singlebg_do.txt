I am trying to determine what the single-background paramter in fiphot does,
because it is not documented (at all), and it is a feature that is in the
HATpipe version of fiphot, but not the version that you just download from
Andras' site.

This parameter shows up in:

* write_comment, which is a `fiphot-io.c` function that does not appear in
  Andras' version (but does in HATpipe)

* write_photometry_text, which is the same as above (only in HATpipe)

* **allocate_phot_columns, which is a "pointer function" (not sure really what
  this means), also only in the HATpipe version.

* output_phot_columns

--------------------

So basically, it's an I/O formatting related error.

It's not at all clear that the updated `fitsh` version of fiphot will be able
to produce photometry files in the same format as the HATpipe version.

So two possible paths:

1) try to get HATpipe's fitsh tools working on phtess2, and switch all the
binary pointers

2) reformat the pipeline code in order to comply with the new (public) fitsh

--------------------

Between the two, seems more sensible to go with #1 (i think Joel already got it
running?)
